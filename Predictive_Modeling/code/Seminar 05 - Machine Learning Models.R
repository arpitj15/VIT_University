#The 'pairs' command creates a scatterplot. Each dot is a data point and its position is determined by the values that data point has for a pair of variables. The class determines the color of the data point. From the plot note that Setosa irises have smaller petals than the other two species.
#We will use the e1071 R package to build a Na√Øve Bayes classifier.

# For this example, our model provides a list of the most likely crimes associated with the unsolved crime C:417. The first two crimes (C:15 and C:26) are solved crimes indicating that the offender(s) responsible for these crimes may also be responsible for C:417. The next two crimes, C:459 and C:446 do not have a group ID. This means that they are unsolved crimes. By providing the posterior probabilities, crime analysts may choose to investigate further only if the linkage is strong enough.
