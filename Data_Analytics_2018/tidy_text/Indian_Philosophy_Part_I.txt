The Natural Situation of India 

For thinking minds to blossom, for arts and sciences to 
flourish, the first condition necessary is a settled society 
providing security and leisure. A rich culture is impossible 
with a community of nomads, where people struggle for life 
and die of privation. Fate called India to a spot where 
nature was free with her gifts and every prospect was pleasing. 
The Himalayas, with their immense range and elevation on 
one side and the sea on the others, helped to keep India 

free from invasion for a long time. ^Bounteous nature

yielded abundant food, and man was relieved of the toil and 
struggle for existence. The Indian never felt that the world 
was a field of battle where men struggled for power, wealth 
and domination. When we do not need to waste our energies 
on problems of life on earth, exploiting nature and controlling 
the forces of the world, w^ begin to think of the higher life, 
how to live more perfectly in the spirit. Perhaps an enervating 
climate inclined the Indian to rest and retirement. The 
huge forests with their wide leafy avenues afforded great 
opportunities for the devout soul to wander peacefully through 
them, dream strange dreams and burst forth into joyous 
songs. World-weary men go out on pilgrimages to these 
scenes of nature, acquire inward peace, listening to the rush 
of winds and torrents, the music of birds and leaves, and return 
whole of heart and fresh in spirit. It was in the asramas 
and tapovanas or forest hermitages that the thinking men of 
India meditated on the deeper problems of existence. The 
security of life, the wealth of natural resources, the freedom 
from worry, the detachment from the cares of existence, 
and the absence of a tyrannous practical interest, stimulated 
the higher life of India, with the result that we find from the 
beginnings of history an impatience of spirit, a love of wisdom 
and a passion for the saner pursuits of the mind. 

Helped by natural conditions, and provided with the 
intellectual scope to think out the implications of things, 
the Indian escaped the doom which Plato pronounced to be 
the worst of all, viz. the hatred of reason. " Let us above 
all things take heed,” says he in the Phcedo, “ that one mis- 
fortune does not befall us. Let us not become misologues 
as some people become misanthropes ; for no greater evil can 
befall men than to become haters of reason.” The pleasure 
of understanding is one of the purest available to man, and 
the passion of the Indian for it burns in the bright flame 
of the mind. 

In many other countries of the world, reflection on the 
nature of existence is a luxury of life. The serious moments 
are given to action, while the pursuit of philosophy comes up 
as a parenthesis. In ancient India philosophy was not an 
auxiliary to any other science or art, but always held a 
prominent position of independence. In the W r est, even

in the heyday of its youth, as in the times of Plato and 
Aristotle, it leaned for support on some other study, as politics 
or ethics. It was theology for the Middle Ages, natural 
science for Bacon a#d Newton, history, politics and sociology 
for the nineteenth-century thinkers. In India philosophy 
stood on its own legs, and all other studies looked to it for 
inspiration and* support. It is the master science guiding 
other sciences, without which they tend to become empty and 
foolish. The Mufidaka Upanisad speaks of Brahma-vidya 
or the science of the eternal as the basis of all sciences, 
sarva-vidya-pratistha. “ Philosophy,” says Kautilya, “ is 
the lamp of all the sciences, the means of performing all 
the works, and the support of all the duties.” 1 

Since philosophy is a human effort to comprehend the 
problem of the universe, it is subject to the influences of race 
and culture. Each nation has its own characteristic mentality, 
its particular intellectual bent. In all the fleeting centuries 
of history, in all the vicissitudes through which India has 
passed, a certain marked identity is visible. It has held 
fast to certain psychological traits which constitute its 
special heritage, and they will be the characteristic marks 
of the Indian people so long as they are privileged to have a 
separate existence. Individuality means independence of 
growth. It is not necessarily unlikeness. There cannot 
be complete unlikeness, since man the world over is the 
same, especially so far as the aspects of spirit are concerned. 
The variations are traceable to distinctions in age, history 
and temperament. They add to the wealth of the world 
culture, since there is no royal road to philosophic develop- 
ment any more than to any other result worth having. Before 
we notice the characteristic features of Indian thought, a 
few words may be said about the influence of the West on 
Indian thought. 

The question is frequently raised whether and to what 
extent Indian thought borrowed its ideas from foreign sources, 
such as Greece. Some of the views put forward by Indian 
thinkers resemble certain doctrines developed in ancient 
Greece, so much that anybody interested in discrediting this

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


or that thought system can easily do so. 1 The question of 
the affiliation of ideas is a useless, pursuit. To an unbiassed 
mind, the coincidences will be an evidence of historical 
parallelism. Similar experiences engender in men’s minds 
similar views. There is no material evidence to prove any 
direct borrowings, at any rate by India, Irom the West. 
Our account of Indian thought will show that it is an inde- 
pendent venture of the human mind. Philosophical problems 
are discussed without any influence from or relation to the 
West. In spite of occasional intercourse with the West, 
India had the freedom to develop its own ideal life, philosophy 
and religion. Whatever be the truth about the original 
home of the Aryans who came down to the Peninsula, they 
soon lost touch with their kindred in the West or the North, 
and developed on lines of their own. It is true that India 
was again and again invaded by armies pouring into it through 
the North-Western passes, but none of them, with the 
exception of Alexander’s, did anything to promote spiritual 
intercourse between the two worlds. Only latterly, when 
the gateway of the seas was opened, a more intimate inter- 
course has been fostered, the results of which we cannot 
forecast, since they are yet in the making. For all practical 
purposes, then, we may look upon Indian thought as a closed 
system or an autonomous growth.

General Characteristics of Indian Thought 

Philosophy in India is essentially spiritual. It is the 
intense spirituality of India, and not any great political 

1 Sir William Jones wrote : " Of the philosophical schools, it will be 
sufficient here to remark that the first Nyaya seems analogous to the 
Peripatetic ; the second, sometimes called Vai£c§ika, to the Ionic ; the 
two MI.i aiiislls, of which the second is often distinguished by the name of 
Vedanta, to the Platonic; the first Samkhya to the Italic; and the second 
of Patanjali to the Stoic philosophy ; so that Gautama corresponds with 
Aristotle, Kapada with Thales, Jaimini with Socrates, Vyasa with 
Plato, Kapila -with Pythagoras, and Patanjali with Zeno ” (Works, i, 
360-1. See also Colebrooke, Miscellaneous Essays, i. 4362.) While the 
opinion that Greek thought has been influenced ify" the Indian is frequently 
held, it is not so often urged that Indian thought owes much to Greek 
speculation. (See Garbe, Philosophy of Ancient India, chap, ii.)

structure or social organisation that it has developed, that 
has enabled it to resist the ravages of time and the accidents 
of history. External invasions and internal dissensions 
came very near crushing its civilisation many times in its 
history. The Greek and the Scythian, the Persian and the 
Mogul, the French and the English have by turn attempted 
to suppress it, and yet it has its head held high. India has 
not been finally subdued, and its old flame of spirit is still 
burning. Throughout its life it has been living with one 
purpose. It has fought for truth and against error. It 
may have blundered, but it did what it felt able and called 
upon to do. The history of Indian thought illustrates the 
endless quest of the mind, ever old, ever new. 

The spiritual motive dominates life in India. Indian 
philosophy has its interest in the haunts of men, and not in 
supra-lunar solitudes. It takes its origin in life, and enters 
back into life after passing through the schools. The great 
works of Indian philosophy do not have that ex cathedra 
character which is so prominent a feature of the latter 
criticisms and commentaries. The Gita and the Upanisads 
are not remote from popular belief. They are the great 
literature of the country, and at the same time vehicles of 
the great systems of thought. The Puranas contain the truth 
dressed up in myths and stories, to suit the weak understanding 
of the majority. The hard task of interesting the multitude 
in metaphysics is achieved in India. 

The founders of philosophy strive for a socio-spiritual 
reformation of the country. When the Indian civilisation 
is called a Brahmanical one, it only means that its main 
character and dominating motives are shaped by its philoso- 
phical thinkers and religious minds, though these are not 
all of Brahmin birth. The idea of Plato that philosophers 
must be the rulers and directors of society is practised in 
India. The ultimate truths are truths of spirit, and in the 
light of them actual life has to be refined. 

Religion in India is not dogmatic. It is a rational 
synthesis which goes on gathering into itself new conceptions 
as philosophy progresses. It is experimental and provisional 
in its nature, attempting to keep pace with the progress of 
thought. The common criticism that Indian thought.

by its emphasis on intellect, puts philosophy in the place of 
religion, brings out the rational character of religion in India. 
No religious movement has ever come into existence with- 
out developing as its support a philosophic content. Mr. 
Havell observes : " In India, religion is hardly a dogma, but 
a working hypothesis of human conduct, adapted to different 
stages of spiritual development and different conditions of 
life.” 1 Whenever it tended to crystallise itself in a fixed 
creed, there were set up spiritual revivals and philosophic 
reactions which threw beliefs into the crucible of criticism, 
vindicated the true and combated the false. Again and again, 
we shall observe, how when traditionally accepted beliefs 
become inadequate, nay false, on account of changed times, 
and the age grows out of patience with them, the insight of 
a new teacher, a Buddha or a Mahavlra, a Vyasa or a 
Samkara supervenes, stirring the depths of spiritual life. 
These are doubtless great moments in the history of Indian 
thought, times of inward testing and vision, when at the 
summons of the spirit’s breath, blowing where it listeth and 
coming whence no one knows, the soul of man makes a fresh 
start and goes forth on a new venture. It is the intimate 
relation between the truth of philosophy and the daily life of 
people that makes religion always alive and real. 

The problems of religion stimulate the philosophic spirit. 
The Indian mind has been traditionally exercised over the 
questions of the nature of Godhead, the end of life and the 
relation of the individual to the universal soul. Though 
philosophy in India has not as a rule completely freed itself 
from the fascinations of religious speculation, yet the philoso- 
phical discussions have not been hampered by religious 
forms. The two were not confused. On account of the 
close connection between theory and practice, doctrine and 
life, a philosophy which could not stand the test of life, not 
in the pragmatistic but the larger sense of the term, had no 
chance of survival. To those who realise the true kinship 
between life and theory, philosophy becomes a way of 
life, an approach to spiritual realisation. There has been 
no teaching, not even the Sariikhya, which remained a mere

word of mouth or dogma of schools. Every doctrine is turned 
into a passionate conviction, stirring the heart of man and 
quickening his breath. 

It is untrue to say that philosophy in India never became 
self-conscious or critical. Even in its early stages rational 
reflection tended to correct religious belief. Witness the 
advance of religion implied in the progress from the hymns of 
the Veda to the Upanisads. When we come to Buddhism, the 
philosophic spirit has already become that confident attitude 
of mind which in intellectual matters bends to no outside 
authority and recognises no limit to its enterprise, unless it 
be as the result of logic, which probes all things, tests all 
things, and follows fearlessly wherever the argument leads. 
When we reach the several darsanas or systems of thought, 
we have mighty and persistent efforts at systematic thinking. 
How completely free from traditional religion and bias the 
systems are will be obvious from the fact that the Samkhya 
is silent about the existence of God, though certain about its 
theoretical indemonstrability. Vaisesika and Yoga, while 
they admit a supreme being, do not consider him to be the 
creator of the universe, and Jaimini refers to God only to 
deny his providence and moral government of the world. 
The early Buddhist systems are known to be indifferent to 
God, and we have also the materialist Carvakas, who deny 
God, ridicule the priests, revile the Vedas and seek salvation 
in pleasure. 

The supremacy of religion and of social tradition in life 
does not hamper the free pursuit of philosophy. It is a 
strange paradox, and yet nothing more than the obvious truth 
that while the social life of an individual is bound by the 
rigours of caste, he is free to roam in the matter of opinion. 
Reason freely questions and criticises the creeds in which men 
are born. That is why the heretic, the sceptic, the un- 
believer, the rationalist and the freethinker, the materialist 
and the hedonist all flourish in the soil of India. The 
Mahabharata says : “ There is no muni w T ho has not an opinion 
of his own.” ' 

All this is evidence of the strong intellectuality of the 
Indian mind which seeks to know the inner truth and the 
law of all sides of human activity. This intellectual impulse

is not confined to philosophy and theology, but extends over 
logic and grammar, rhetoric and language, medicine and 
astronomy, in fact all arts and sciences, from architecture 
to zoology. Everything useful to life or interesting to mind 
becomes an object of inquiry and criticism. It will give 
an idea of the all comprehensive character of intellectual 
life, to know that even such minutiae as the breeding of 
horses and the training of elephants had their own sastras 
and literature. 

The philosophic attempt to determine the nature of 
reality may start either with the thinking self or the objects 
of thought. In India the interest of philosophy is in the self of 
man. Where the vision is turned outward, the rush of fleeting 
events engages the mind. In India “ Atmanam viddhi,” 
know the self, sums up the law and the prophets. Within 
man is the spirit that is the centre of everything. , Psychology 
and ethics are the basal sciences. \The life of mind is depicted 
in all its mobile variety and subtle play of light and shade 
Indian psychology realised the value of concentration and 
looked upon it as the means for the perception of the truth! 
It believed that there were no ranges of life or mind which 
could not be reached by a methodical training of will and 
knowledge. It recognised the close connexion of mind and 
body. The psychic experiences, such as telepathy and 
clairvoyance, were considered to be neither abnormal nor 
miraculous. They are not the products of diseased minds 
or inspiration from the gods, but powers which the human 
mind can exhibit under carefully ascertained conditions. 
The mind of man has the three aspects of the subconscious, 
the conscious and the superconscious, and the “ abnormal ” 
psychic phenomena, called by the different names of ecstasy, 
genius, inspiration, madness, are the workings of the super- 
conscious mind. The Yoga system of philosophy deals 
specially with these experiences, though the other systems 
refer to them and utilise them for their purposes. 

The metaphysical schemes are based on the data of the 
psychological science. The criticism that Western meta- 
physics is one-sided, since its attention is confined to the 
waking state alone, is not without its force. There are other 
states of consciousness as much entitled to consideration as 



INTRODUCTION

the waking. Indian thought takes into account the modes 
of waking, dreaming and dreamless sleep. If we look upon 
the waking consciousness as the whole, then we get realistic, 
dualistic and pluralistic conceptions of metaphysics. Dream 
consciousness when exclusively studied leads us to subjectivist 
doctrines. The state of dreamless sleep inclines us to 
abstract and mystical theories. The whole truth must take 
all the modes of consciousness into account. 

The dominance of interest in the subjective does not mean 
that in objective sciences India had nothing to say. If we 
refer to the actual achievements of India in the realm of 
positive science, we shall see that the opposite is the case. 
Ancient Indians laid the foundations of mathematical and 
mechanical knowledge. They measured the land, divided 
the year, mapped out the heavens, traced the course of the 
sun and the planets through the zodiacal belt, analysed the 
constitution of matter, and studied the nature of birds and 
beasts, plants and seeds . 1 “ Whatever conclusions we may 
arrive at as to the original source of the first astronomical 
ideas current in the world, it is probable that to the Hindus 
is due the invention of algebra and its application to 
astronomy and geometry. From them also the Arabs received 
not only their first conceptions of algebraic analysis, but also 
those invaluable numerical symbols and decimal notation now 
current everywhere in Europe, which have rendered untold 
service to the progress of arithmetical science. ” 1 “ The 

motions of the moon and the sun were carefully observed 
by the Hindus, and with such success that their determination 
of the moon’s synodical revolution is a much more correct 
one than the Greeks ever achieved. They had a division of 
the ecliptic into twenty-seven and twenty-eight parts, 
suggested evidently by the moon’s period in days and 

1 We may quote a passage which is certainly not less than 2,000 years 
before the birth of Copernicus, from the Aitareya Brahmaga : “ The sun 
never sets nor rises. When people think to themselves the sun is setting, 
he only changes about after reaching the end of the day, and makes night 
below and day to what is on the other side. Then when people think he 
rises in the morning, he only shifts himself about after reaching the end 
of the night, and makes day below and night to what is on the other side. 
In fact he never docs set at all." Haug’s Edition, iii. 44 ; Chan. Up., iii. 
11. 1-3. Even if this be folklore, it is interesting.

seemingly their own. They were particularly conversant 
with the most splendid of the primary planets ; the period 
of Jupiter being introduced by them, in conjunction with 
those of the sun and the moon into the regulation of their 
calendar in the form of the cycle of sixty years, common 
to them and the Chaldeans.” 1 It is now admitted that the 
Hindus at a very early time conceived and developed the 
two sciences of logic and grammar. 1 Wilson writes : “ In 
medicine, as in astronomy and metaphysics, the Hindus once 
kept pace with the most enlightened nations of the world ; 
and they attained as thorough a proficiency in medicine and 
surgery as any people whose acquisitions are recorded, and 
as indeed was practicable, before anatomy was made known 
to us by the discoveries of modern inquirers.” 3 It is true 
that they did not invent any great mechanical appliances. 
For this a kind Heaven, which gave them the great water- 
courses and abundant supplies of food, is responsible. Let 
us also remember that these mechanical inventions belong, 
after all, to the sixteenth century and after, by which time 
India had lost her independence and become parasitic. 
The day she lost her freedom and began to flirt with other 
nations, a curse fell on her and she became petrified. Till 
then she could hold her own even in arts, crafts and industries, 
not to speak of mathematics, astronomy, chemistry, medicine, 
surgery, and those branches of physical knowledge practised 
in ancient times. She knew how to chisel stone, draw pictures, 
burnish gold and weave rich fabrics. She developed all 
arts, fine and industrial, which furnish the conditions of 
civilised existence. Her ships crossed the oceans and her 
wealth brimmed over to Judaea, Egypt and Rome. Her 
conceptions of man and society, morals and religion were 
remarkable for the time. We cannot reasonably say that 
the Indian people revelled in poetry and mythology, and 
spurned science and philosophy, though it is true that they 
were more intent on seeking the unity of things than 
emphasising their sharpness and separation. 

The speculative mind is more synthetic, while the scientific

one is more analytic, if such a distinction be permitted. 
The former tends to create cosmic philosophies which 
embrace in one comprehensive vision the origin of all 
things, the history of ages and the dissolution and decay 
of the world. The latter is inclined to linger over the dull 
particulars of the world and miss the sense of oneness and 
wholeness. Indian thought attempts vast, impersonal views 
of existence, and makes it easy for the critic to bring the 
charge of being more idealistic and contemplative, producing 
dreamy visionaries and strangers in the world, while Western 
thought is more particularist and pragmatistic. The latter 
depends on what we call the senses, the former presses the 
soul sense into the service of speculation. Once again it 
is the natural conditions of India that account for the 
contemplative turn of the Indian who had the leisure to enjoy 
the beautiful things of the world and express his wealth of 
soul in song and story, music and dance, rites and religions, 
undisturbed by the passions of the outer world. “ The 
brooding East,” frequently employed as a term of ridicule, 
is not altogether without its truth. 

It is the synthetic vision of India that has made philosophy 
comprehend several sciences which have become differentiated 
in modern times. In the West during the last hundred years 
or so several branches of knowledge till then included under 
philosophy, economics, politics, morals, psychology, education 
have been one by one sheared away from it. Philosophy 
in the time of Plato meant all those sciences which are bound 
up with human nature and form the core of man's speculative 
interests. In the same way in ancient Indian scriptures we 
possess the full content of the philosophic sphere. Latterly 
in the West philosophy became synonymous with metaphysics, 
or the abstruse discussions of knowledge, being and value, 
and the complaint is heard that metaphysics has become 
absolutely theoretical, being cut off from the imaginative 
and the practical sides of human nature. 

If we put the subjective interest of the Indian mind 
along with its tendency to arrive at a synthetic vision, we 
shall see how monistic idealism becomes the truth of things- 
To it the w r hole growth of Vedic thought points ; on it are 
based the Buddhistic and the Brahmanical religions ; it is 



32 


INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


the highest truth revealed to India. Even systems which 
announce themselves as aualistic or pluralistic seem to be 
permeated by a strong monistic character. If we can abstract 
from the variety of opinion and observe the general spirit 
of Indian thought, we shall find that it has a disposition 
to interpret life and nature in the way of monistic idealism, 
though this tendency is so plastic, living and manifold that 
it takes many forms and expresses itself in even mutually 
hostile teachings. We may briefly indicate the main forms 
which monistic idealism has assumed in Indian thought, 
leaving aside detailed developments and critical estimates. 
This will enable us to grasp the nature and function of 
philosophy as understood in India. For our purposes 
monistic idealism is of four types : (i) Non-dualism or 

Advaitism ; (2) Pure monism ; (3) Modified monism ; and 
(4) Implicit monism. 

Philosophy proceeds on the facts of experience. Logical 
reflection is necessary to ascertain whether the facts observed 
by one individual are accepted by all, or are only subjective 
in their character. Theories are accepted if they account 
for facts satisfactorily. We have already said that the facts 
of mind or consciousness were studied by the Indian thinkers 
with as much care and attention as the facts of the outer 
world are studied by our modern scientists. The philosophical 
conclusions of Advaitic monism are based on the data of 
psychological observation. 

The activities of the self are assigned to the three states 
of waking, dreaming and dreamless sleep. In dream states 
an actual concrete world is presented to us. We do not call 
that world real, since on waking we find that the dream world 
does not fit in with the waking world ; yet relatively to the 
dream state the dream world is real. It is discrepancy 
from our conventional standards of waking life, and not any 
absolute knowledge of truth as subsisting by itself, that tells 
us that dream states are less real than the waking ones. 
Even waking reality is a relative one. It has no permanent 
existence, being only a correlate of the waking state. It 
disappears in dream and sleep. The waking consciousness 
and the world disclosed to it are related to each other, depend 
on each other as the dream consciousness and the dream-

world are. They are not absolutely real, for in the words 
of Samkara, while the “ dream-world is daily sublated, the 
waking world is sublatrd under exceptional circumstances.” 
In dreamless sleep we have a cessation of the empirical 
consciousness. Some Indian thinkers are of opinion that we 
have in this condition an objectless consciousness. At 
any rate this is clear, that dreamless sleep is not a complete 
non-being or negation for such a hypothesis conflicts with the 
later recollection of the happy repose of sleep. We cannot 
help conceding that the self continues to exist, though it is 
bereft of all experience. There is no object felt and there 
can be none so long as the sleep is sound. The pure self 
seems to be unaffected by the flotsam and jetsam of ideas 
which rise and vanish with particular moods. " What 
varies not, nor changes in the midst of things that vary and 
change is different from them.” 1 The self which persists 
unchanged and is one throughout all the changes is different 
from them all. The conditions change, not the self. “ In 
all the endless months, years and small and great cycles, 
past and to come, this self-luminous consciousness alone 
neither rises nor ever sets.” * An unconditioned reality 
where time and space along with all their objects vanish is 
felt to be real. It is the self which is the unaffected spectator 
of the whole drama of ideas related to the changing moods 
of waking, dreaming and sleeping. We are convinced that 
there is something in us beyond joy and misery, virtue and 
vice, good and bad. The self " never dies, is never bom — 
unborn, eternal, everlasting, this ancient one can never be 
destroyed with the destruction of the body. If the slayer 
thinks he can slay, or if the slain thinks he is slain, they 
both do not know the truth, for the self neither slays nor is 
slain.” 3 

In addition to the ever-identical self, we have also the 
empirical variety of objects. The former is permanent, 
immutable, the latter impermanent and ever changing. 
The former is absolute, being independent of all objects, 
the latter changes with the moods.

How are we to account for the world ? The empirical 
variety is there bound in space, time and cause. If the self 
is the one, the universal, the immutable, we find in the world 
a mass of particulars with opposed characters. We can only 
call it the not-self, the object of a subject. In no case is it 
real. The principal categories of the world of experience, 
time, space and cause are self-contradictory. They are 
relative terms depending on their constituents. They have 
no real existence. Yet they are not non-existent. The 
world is there, and we work in it and through it. We do not 
and cannot know the why of this world. It is this fact 
of its inexplicable existence that is signified by the word 
mdya. To ask what is the relation between the absolute self 
and the empirical flux, to ask why and how it happens, 
that there are two, is to assume that everything has a why 
and a how. To say that the infinite becomes the finite or 
manifests itself as finite is on this view utter nonsense. 
The limited cannot express or manifest the unlimited. The 
moment the unlimited manifests itself in the limited, it 
itself becomes limited. To say that the absolute degenerates 
or lapses into the empirical is to contradict its absoluteness. 
No lapse can come to a perfect being. No darkness can dwell 
in perfect light. We cannot admit that the supreme, which 
is changeless, becomes limited by changing. To change 
is to desire or to feel a want, and it shows lack of perfection. 
The absolute can never become an object of knowledge, for 
what is known is finite and relative. Our limited mind cannot 
go beyond the bounds of time, space and cause, nor can we 
explain these, since every attempt to explain them assumes 
them. Through thought, which is itself a part of the relative 
world, we cannot know the absolute self. Our relative 
experience is a waking dream. Science and logic are parts 
of it and products of it too. This failure of metaphysics 
is neither to be wept over nor to be laughed over, neither to 
be praised nor blamed, but understood. With a touching 
humility born of intellectual strength, a Plato, or a Nagarjuna, 
a Kant or a £amkara, declares that our thought deals with 
the relative, and has nothing to do with the absolute. 

Though the absolute being is not known in the logical 
way, it is yet realised by all who strain to know the truth, as

the reality in which we live, move and have our being. Only 
through it can anything else be known. It is the eternal 
witness of all knowledge. The non-dualist contends that 
his theory is based on the logic of facts. The self is the inmost 
and deepest reality, felt by all, since it is the self of all things 
known and unknown too, and there is no knower to know 
it except itself. It is the true and the eternal, and there is 
nought beside it. As for the empirical ramifications which 
also exist, the non-dualist says, well, they are there, and there 
is an end of it. We do not know and cannot know why. It 
is all a contradiction, and yet is actual. Such is the philoso- 
phical position of Advaita or non-dualism taken up by Gauda- 
pada and Ssaiiikara. 

There are Advaitins who are dissatisfied with this view, 
and feel that it is no good covering up our confusion by the 
use of the word maya. They attempt to give a more positive 
account of the relation between the perfect being absolutely 
devoid of any negativity, the immutable real, felt in the 
depths of experience and the world of change and becoming. 
To preserve the perfection of the one reality we are obliged 
to say that the world of becoming is not due to an addition 
of any element from outside, since there is nothing outside. 
It can only be by a diminution. Something negative like 
Plato’s non-being or Aristotle’s matter is assumed to account 
for change. Through the exercise of this negative principle, 
the immutable seems to be spread out in the moving many. 
Rays stream out of the sun which nevertheless did not contain 
them. Maya is the name of the negative principle which 
lets loose the universal becoming, thereby creating endless 
agitation and perpetual disquiet. The flux of the universe 
is brought about by the apparent degradation of the 
immutable. The real represents all that is positive in be- 
coming. The things of the world ever struggle to recover 
their reality, to fill up what is lacking in them, to shake off 
their individuality and separateness, but are prevented from 
doing so by their inner void, the negative maya constituted 
by the interval between what they are and what they ought 
to be. If we get rid of maya, suppress the tendency to duality, 
abolish the interval, fill up the deficit, and allow the 
disturbance to relax, space, time and change reach back into 
von. i 2 *

pure being. As long as the original insufficiency of maya 
prevails, things are condemned to be existent in space— 
time — cause world. Maya is not a human construction. 
It is prior to our intellect and independent of it. It is verily 
the generator of things and intellects, the immense potentiality 
of the whole world. It is sometimes called the prakrti. 
The alternations of generation and decay, the ever-repeated 
cosmic evolutions, all represent this fundamental deficit 
in which the world consists. The world of becoming is the 
interruption of being. Maya is the reflection of reality. 
The world-process is not so much a translation of immutable 
being as its inversion. Yet the world of maya cannot exist 
apart from pure being. There can be no movement, if there 
were not immutability, since movement is only a degradation 
of the immutable. The truth of the universal mobility is 
the immobile being. 

As becoming is a lapse from being, so is avidya or ignorance 
a fall from vidya or knowledge. To know the truth, to 
apprehend reality, we have to get rid of avidya and its 
intellectual moulds, which all crack the moment we try to 
force reality into them. This is no excuse for indolence 
of thought. Philosophy as logic on this view persuades 
us to give up the employment of the intellectual concepts 
which are relative to our practical needs and the world of 
becoming. Philosophy tells us that, so long as we are bound 
by intellect and are lost in the world of many, we shall seek 
in vain to get back to the simplicity of the one. If we ask 
the reason why there is avidya, or maya, bringing about a fall 
from vidya or from being, the question cannot be answered. 
Philosophy as logic has here the negative function of exposing 
the inadequacy of all intellectual categories, pointing out how 
the objects of the world are relative to the mind that thinks 
them and possess no independent existence. It cannot 
tell us anything definite about either the immutable said to 
exist apart from what is happening in the world, or about 
maya, credited with the production of the world. It cannot 
help us directly to the attainment of reality. It, on the other 
hand, tells us that to measure reality we have to distort 
it. It may perhaps serve the interests of truth when once 
it is independently ascertained. We can think it out,

defend it logically and help its propagation. The supporters 
of pure monism recognise a higher power than abstract 
intellect which enables us to feel the push of reality. We 
have to sink ourselves in the universal consciousness and make 
ourselves co-extensive with all that is. We do not then so 
much think reality as live it, do not so much know it as become 
it. Such an extreme monism, with its distinctions of logic 
and intuition, reality and the world of existence, we meet 
with in some Upanisads, Nagurjuna and Samkara in his 
ultra-philosophical moods, 5ri Harsa and the Advaita 
Vedantins, and echoes of it are heard in Parmenides and 
Plato, Spinoza and Plotinus, Bradley and Bergson, not to 
speak of the mystics, in the West. 1 

Whatever the being, pure and simple, may be to intuition, 
to intellect it is nothing more or less than an absolute 
abstraction. It is supposed to continue when every fact 
and form of existence is abolished. It is the residue left 
behind when abstraction is made from the whole world. It 
is a difficult exercise set to the thought of man to think away 
the sea and the earth, the sun and the stars, space and time, 
man and God. When an effort is made to abolish the whole 
universe, sublate all existence, nothing seems to remain for 
thought. Thought, finite and relational, finds to its utter 
despair that there is just nothing at all when everything 
existent is abolished. To the conceptual mind the central 
proposition of intuition, “ Being only is,” means that there 
is just nothing at all. Thought, as Hegel said, can only work 
with determinate realities, concrete things. To it all 
affirmation implies negation, and vice versa. Every concrete 
is a becoming, combining being and non-being, positive 
and negative. So those who are not satisfied with the intuited 
being, and wish to have a synthesis capable of being attained 
by thought which has a natural instinct for the concrete, 
are attracted to a system of objective idealism. The concrete 
idealists try to put together the two concepts of pure being 

1 In the Samkhya philosophy we have practically the same account 
of the world of experience, which does not in the least stain the purity of 
the witness self. Only a pluralistic prejudice which has no logical basis 
asserts itself, and we have a plurality of souls. When the pluralism collapses, 
as it does at the first touch of logic, the SSmkhya theory becomes identical 
with the pure monism here sketched.

and apparent becoming in the single synthesis of God. Even 
extreme monists recognise that becoming depends on being, 
though not vice versa. We get now a sort of refracted 
absolute, a God who has in Him the possibility of the world, 
combines in His nature the essence of all being, as well as of 
becoming, unity as well as plurality, unlimitedness and 
limitation. The pure being now becomes the subject, 
transforming itself into object and taking back the object 
into itself. Position, opposition, and composition, to use 
Hegelian expressions, go on in an eternal circular process. 
Hegel rightly perceives that the conditions of a concrete 
world are a subject and an object. These two opposites 
are combined in every concrete. The great God Himself 
has in Him the two antagonistic characters where the one is 
not only through the other, but is actually the other. When 
such a dynamic God eternally bound in the rotating wheel 
is asserted, all the degrees of existence, from the divine 
perfection up to vile dust, are automatically realised. The 
affirmation of God is the simultaneous affirmation of all 
degrees of reality between it and nothing. We have now the 
universe of thought constructed by thought, answering 
to thought and sustained by thought, in which subject and 
object are absorbed as moments. The relations of space, 
time and cause are not subjective forms, but universal 
principles of thought. If on the view of pure monism we 
cannot understand the exact relation between identity and 
difference, we are here on better ground. The world is 
identity gone into difference. Neither is isolated from the 
other. God is the inner ground, the basis of identity ; the 
world is the outer manifestation, the externalisation of self- 
consciousness. 

Such a God, according to the theory of pure monism, is 
just the lapse from the absolute, with the least conceivable 
interval separating him from pure being or the absolute. 
It is the product of avidya which is separated from vidya by 
the least conceivable extent. In other words, this concrete 
God is the highest product of our highest intelligence. The 
pity is, that it is a product after all, and our intelligence, 
however near it approximates to vidya, is not yet vidya. 
This God has in him the maximum of being and the minimum

of defect — still a defect. The first touch of maya, the 
slightest diminution of absolute being, is enough to throw 
it into space and time, though this space and this time will 
be as near as possible to the absolute unextendedness and 
eternity. The absolute one is converted into the Creator 
God existent in some space, moving all things from within 
without stirring from His place. God is the absolute 
objectivised as something somewhere, a spirit that pushes 
itself into everything. He is being-non-being, Brahman- 
maya, subject-object, eternal force, the motionless mover 
of Aristotle, the absolute spirit of Hegel, the (absolute- 
relative) viSistadvaita of Ramanuja, the efficient as well as 
the final cause of the universe. The world is beginningless 
and endless, since the energising of God could not have begun 
and could never come to an end. It is its essential nature 
to be ever at unrest. 

There is no doubt that this is the highest conception 
which thought can reach. If we follow to the end the natural 
movement of our intellect which tries to unify the things of 
the world and synthesise opposites, a principle of explanation 
which is neither pure being nor pure non-being, but something 
which combines both, is what we get. This concept is 
constructed by a compression of all things into the whole. 
Philosophy on this view is constructive in character, and is 
therefore positive in its nature and synthetic in its function. 
Even here logical understanding playing with abstractions 
shuts us from the concrete in which alone the abstractions 
live, move and have their being. Thought as reason gets 
over the difficulties of logical understanding. Starting from 
the world of experience, we go up to the ultimate principle 
of God, and from the conception of the whole so gained 
we descend into details and review the parts. All logical 
dogmatisms wlrich have confidence in the power of thought 
end with this conception of the world. The difficulty arises 
if we doubt the absoluteness of thought. May not our know- 
ledge be relative to the requirements of the mind which 
unifies and divides ? Perhaps for a mind differently shaped, 
knowledge may be different from what it is. Our present 
knowledge makes us think that all knowledge will be of this 
type, but when there are critics who dispute such an assertion. 



40 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

it is difficult to defend the position. Admitting that the 
conceptual plan of reality revealed to thought is true, still, 
it is sometimes urged, thought is not identical with reality. 
By compressing all concepts into one, we do not go beyond 
concepts. A relation is only a part of the mind that relates. 
Even an infinitely superior mind is yet a mind and of the 
same mould as man’s. The theory of modified monism is 
adopted by some Upanisads, and the Bhagavadgita, some 
followers of Buddhism and Ramanuja, if not Badarayana. 
In the West Aristotle and Hegel stand out as witnesses 
to it. 

According to the first view perfect being is real ; unreal 
becoming is actual, though, we do not know why. According 
to the second, the world becoming is a precipitation (apparent) 
of pure being into space and time by the force of diminution 
or xnaya. According to the third, the highest product we 
have is a synthesis of pure being and not-being in God. 
We are immediately under a logical necessity to affirm all 
intermediate degrees of reality. If pure being is dismissed 
as a concept useless so far as the world of experience is 
concerned and we also disregard as illogical the idea of a 
Creator God, then what exists is nothing more than a mere 
flux of becoming, ever aspiring to be something else than 
what it is. The main principle of Buddhism results. In 
the world of existence, on the hypothesis of modified monism, 
the specific characters of the degrees of intermediate reality 
are to be measured by the distance separating them from the 
integral reality. The common characters of all of them are 
existence in space and time. Closer attention reveals to 
us more and more special attributes. Admit the distinction 
between thinking reals and unthinking objects, and we have 
the dualistic philosophy of Madhva. Even this is funda- 
mentally a monism so long as the reals are dependent (para- 
tantra) on God, who alone is independent (svatantra). 
Emphasise the independence of the thinking beings, and we 
have pluralism according to Sarhkhya, if only we do not worry 
about the existence of God which cannot be demonstrated. 
Add to it the plurality of the objects of the world, we have 
pluralistic realism, where even God becomes one real, however 
great or powerful, among others. In the discussions about 



INTRODUCTION 


41 


the intermediate degrees of reality the unit of individuality 
seems to depend upon the fancy of the philosopher. And 
whether a system turns out atheistic or theistic is determined 
by the attention paid to the absolute under the segis of which 
the drama of the universe is enacted. It sometimes shines 
out brilliantly with its light focussed in a God and at other 
times fades out. These are the different ways in which the 
mind of man reacts to the problems of the world according 
to its own peculiar constitution. 

There is a cordial harmony between God and man in 
Indian thought, while the opposition between the two is 
more marked in the West. The mythologies of the peoples 
also indicate it. The myth of Prometheus, the representative 
man, who tries to help mankind by defending them against 
Zeus who desires to destroy the human race and supplant 
them with a new and better species, the story of the labours 
of Hercules who tries to redeem the world, the conception 
of Christ as the Son of Man, indicate that man is the centre 
of attention in the West. It is true that Christ is also called 
the Son of God, the eldest begotten who is to be sacrificed 
before a just God’s anger can be appeased. Our point here 
is that the main tendency of Western culture is an opposition 
between man and God, where man resists the might of God, 
steals fire from him in the interests of humanity. In India 
man is a product of God. The whole world is due to the 
sacrifice of God. The Purusa Sukta speaks of such an eternal 
sacrifice which sustains man and the world . 1 In it the whole 
world is pictured as one single being of incomparable vastness 
and immensity, animated by one spirit, including within its 
substance all forms of life. 

The dominant character of the Indian mind which has 
coloured all its culture and moulded all its thoughts is the 
spiritual tendency. Spiritual experience is the foundation 
of India’s rich cultural history. It is mysticism, not in the 
sense of involving the exercise of any mysterious power, 
but only as insisting on a discipline of human nature, leading 
to a realisation of the spiritual. While the sacred scriptures 
of the Hebrews and the Christians are more religious and 
ethical, those of the Hindus are more spiritual and

42 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

contemplative. The one fact of life in India is the Eternal 
Being of God. 

It is the ultimate presupposition of all philosophy that 
nothing real can be self-contradictory. In the history of 
thought it takes some time to realise the importance of this 
presupposition, and make a conscious application of it. In 
the Rgveda there is an unconscious acceptance of the validity 
of ordinary knowledge. When we reach the stage of the 
Upanisads, dialectical problems emerge and the difficulties 
of knowledge are felt. In them we find an attempt made to 
mark the limits of knowledge and provide room for intuition, 
but all in a semi-philosophical way. When faith in the 
power of reason was shaken, scepticism supervened, and 
materialists and nihilists came upon the scene. Admitting 
the Upanisad position that the unseen reality cannot be 
comprehended by the logical intellect, Buddhism enforced 
the unsubstantiality of the world. To it, contradiction is 
of the nature of things, and the world of experience is nothing 
more than a tension of opposites. We cannot know if there 
is anything more than the actual, and this cannot be real 
since it is self-contradictory. Such a conclusion was the end 
of the Buddhistic development. We have in the theory of 
Nagarjuna a philosophically sustained statement of the 
central position of the Upanisads. There is a real, though 
we cannot know it ; and what we know is not real, for every 
interpretation of the world as an intelligible system breaks 
down. All this prepared the way for a self-conscious 
criticism of reason. Thought itself is self -contradictory 
or inadequate. Differences arise when the question is put, 
why exactly it is incapable of grasping reality. Is it because 
it deals with parts and not the whole, or is it because of its 
structural incapacity or innate self-contradictoriness ? As 
we have seen, there are those who hold to the rationality of 
the real with the reservation that reality is not mere reason. 
So thought is incapable of giving us the whole of reality. 
The “ that ” exceeds the “ what ” in Bradley’s words. 
Thought gives us knowledge of reality, but it is only know- 
ledge, and not reality. There are others who feel that the 
real is self-consistent, and whatever is thought is self-contra- 
dictory. Thought works with the opposition of subject

and object, and the absolute real is something In which these 
antitheses are annulled. The most concrete thought, in 
so far as it tries to combine a many in one, is still abstract, 
because it is self-contradictory, and if we want to grasp the 
real, we have to give up thought. On the first hypothesis, 
what thought reveals is not opposed to reality, but is 
revelatory of a part of it. Partial views are contradictory 
only because they are partial. They are true so far as they 
go, but they are not the whole truth. The second hypothesis 
tells us that reality can be apprehended by a form of feeling 
or intuition . 1 The first view also insists on a supplementing 
of thought by feeling, if reality is to be attained in its fullness. 
We seem to require another element in addition to thought, 
and this is suggested by the term “ darsana,” which is used 
to describe a system of philosophy, doctrine or sastra. 

The term “ darSana ” comes from the word drs, to see. 
This seeing may be either perceptual observation or conceptual 
knowledge or intuitional experience. It may be inspection 
of facts, logical inquiry or insight of soul. Generally, 
" darsanas ” mean critical expositions, logical surveys, or 
systems. We do not find the word used in .this reference 
in the early stages of philosophical thought, when philosophy 
was more intuitional. It shows that “ darsana ” is not an 
intuition, however much it may be allied to it. Perhaps 
the word is advisedly used, to indicate a thought system 
acquired by intuitive experience and sustained by logical 
argument. In the systems of extreme monism philosophy 
prepares the way for intuitional experience by giving us an 
idea of the impotence of thought. In the systems of moderate 
monism, where the real is a concrete whole, philosophy succeeds 
at best in giving an ideal reconstruction of reality. But the 
real transcends, surrounds and overflows our miserable 
categories. In extreme monism it is intuitional experience 
that reveals to us the fullness of reality ; in concrete monism, 
it is insight, where knowledge is penetrated by feeling and 
emotion. Conceptual constructions do not possess the 
certainty of experienced facts. Again, an opinion or 

1 Cl. Bradley, who says that we can reach reality through a kind of 
feeling, and McTaggart, who looks upon love as the most satisfactory way 
of characterising the absolute. 



44 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

logical view becomes truth only if it stands the test 
of life. 

" Darsana ” is a word which is conveniently vague, as 
it stands for a dialectical defence of extreme monism as 
well as the intuitional truth on which it is based. Philo- 
sophically " darsana ” is putting the intuition to proof and 
propagating it logically. Even in other systems it applies 
to the logical exposition of the truth that could be had in 
conceptual terms with or without the aid of any vivifying 
intuition. “ Darsana ” so applies to all views of reality 
taken by the mind of man, and if reality is one, the different 
views attempting to reveal the same must agree with each 
other. They cannot have anything accidental or contingent, 
but must reflect the different view-points obtained of the one 
real. By a close consideration of the several views our mind 
gets by snap-shotting reality from different points, we rise 
to the second stage of a full rendering of reality in logical 
terms. When we realise the inadequacy of a conceptual 
account to reality, we try to seize the real by intuition, where 
the intellectual ideas are swallowed up. It is then that we 
are said to get the pure “ being ” of extreme monism from 
which we get back to the logical real of thought, which again 
we begin to spell letter by letter in the different systems 
themselves. “ Dariana ” as applicable to this last means 
any scientific account of reality. It is the one word that 
stands for all the complex inspiration of philosophy by its 
beautiful vagueness. 

A " darsana ” is a spiritual perception, a whole view 
revealed to the soul sense. This soul sight, which is possible 
only when and where philosophy is lived, is the distinguishing 
mark of a true philosopher. So the highest triumphs of 
philosophy are possible only to those who have achieved 
in themselves a purity of soul. This purity is based upon 
a profound acceptance of experience, realised only when some 
point of hidden strength within man, from which he can not 
only inspect but comprehend life, is found. From this inner 
source the philosopher reveals to us the truth of life, a truth 
which mere intellect is unable to discover. The vision 
is produced almost as naturally as a fruit from a flower out 
of the mysterious centre where all experience is reconciled. 



INTRODUCTION 


45 


The seeker after truth must satisfy certain essential 
conditions before he sets out on his quest. Samkara, in his 
commentary on the first Sutra of the Vedanta Sutras, makes 
out that four conditions are essential for any student of 
philosophy. The first condition is a knowledge of the 
distinction between the eternal and the non-eternal. This 
does not mean full knowledge, w r hich can come only at the 
end, but only a metaphysical bent which does not accept 
all it sees to be absolutely real, a questioning tendency in 
the inquirer. He must have the inquiring spirit to probe 
all things, a burning imagination which could extract a truth 
from a mass of apparently disconnected data, and a habit 
of meditation which will not allow his mind to dissipate 
itself. The second condition is the subjugation of the desire 
for the fruits of action either in the present life or a future 
one. It demands the renunciation of all petty desire, personal 
motive and practical interest. Speculation or inquiry to 
the reflective mind is its own end. The right employment 
of intellect is understanding the things, good as well as bad. 
The philosopher is a naturalist who should follow the move- 
ment of things without exaggerating the good or belittling 
the evil on behalf of some prejudice of his. He must stand 
outside of life and look on it. So it is said that he must have 
no love of the present or the future. Only then can he stake 
his all on clear thinking and honest judgment and develop 
an impersonal cosmic outlook with devotedness to fact. 
To get this temper he must suffer a change of heart, which 
is insisted on in the third condition, where the student is 
enjoined to acquire tranquillity, self-restraint, renunciation, 
patience, peace of mind and faith. Only a trained mind which 
utterly controls the body can inquire and meditate endlessly 
so long as life remains, never for a moment losing sight of 
the object, never for a moment letting it be obscured by any 
terrestrial temptation. The seeker after truth must have the 
necessary courage to lose all for his highest end. So is he 
required to undergo hard discipline, spurn pleasure, suffer 
sorrow and contempt. A spiritual discipline which includes 
pitiless self-examination will enable the seeker to reach his 
end of freedom. The desire for moksa or release is the fourth 
condition. The metaphysically minded man who has given 



46 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

up all his desires and trained his mind has only one devouring 
desire to achieve the end or reach the eternal. The people 
of India have such an immense respect for these philosophers 
who glory in the might of knowledge and the power of intellect, 
that they worship them. The prophetic souls who with a 
noble passion for truth strive hard to understand the mystery 
of the world and give utterance to it, spending laborious 
days and sleepless nights, are philosophers in a vital sense 
of the term. They comprehend experience on behalf of 
mankind, and so the latter are eternally grateful to them. 

Reverence for the past is another national trait. There 
is a certain doggedness of temperament, a stubborn loyalty 
to lose nothing in the long march of the ages. When 
confronted with new cultures or sudden extensions of know- 
ledge, the Indian does not yield to the temptations of the 
hour, but holds fast to his traditional faith, importing as much 
as possible of the new into the old. This conservative 
liberalism is the secret of the success of Indian culture and 
civilisation. Of the great civilisations of the world, hoary 
with age, only the Indian still survives. The magnificence 
of the Egyptian civilisation can be learnt only from the 
reports of the archeologists and the readings of the hiero- 
glyphics ; the Babylonian Empire, with its marvels of scientific, 
irrigation and engineering skill, is to-day notliing more than a 
heap of ruins ; the great Roman culture, with its political 
institutions and ideals of law and equality, is, to a large extent, 
a thing of the past. The Indian civilisation, which even at the 
lowest estimate is 4,000 years old, still survives in its essential 
features. Her civilisation, dating back to the period of the 
Vedas, is young and old at the same time. She has been 
renewing her youth whenever the course of history demanded 
it. When a change occurs, it is not consciously felt to be 
a change. It is achieved, and all the time it professes to be 
only a new name for an old way of thinking. In the Rgveda 
we shall see how the religious consciousness of the Aryan 
invaders takes note of the conceptions of the people of the 
soil. In the Atharva Veda we find that the vaguer cosmic 
deities are added to the gods of the sky and sun, fire and wind 
worshipped by the Aryan peoples from the Ganges to the 
Hellespont. The Upanisads are regaided as a revival or

rather a realisation of something found already in the Vedic 
hymns. The Bhagavadgita professes to sum up the teachings 
of the Upanisads. We have in the Epics the meeting-point 
of the religious conceptions of the highest import with the 
early nature worship. To respect the spirit of reverence 
in man for the ancient makes for the success of the new. 1 
The old spirit is maintained, though not the old forms. This 
tendency to preserve the type has led to the fashionable 
remark that India is immobile. The mind of man never 
stands still, though it admits of no absolute breach with the 
past. 

This respect for the past has produced a regular continuity 
in Indian thought, where the ages are bound each to each 
by natural piety. The Hindu culture is a product of ages 
of change wrought by hundreds of generations, of which some 
are long, stale and sad, and others short, quick and joyous, 
where each has added something of quality to the great 
rich tradition which is yet alive, though it bears within it 
the marks of the dead past. The career of Indian philosophy 
has been compared to the course of a stream which, tumbling 
joyfully from its source among the northern mountain tops, 
rushes through the shadowy valleys and plains, catching 
the lesser streams in its imperious current, till it sweeps 
increased to majesty and serene power through the lands and 
peoples whose fortunes it affects, bearing a thousand ships 
on its bosom. Who knows whether and when this mighty 
stream which yet flows on with tumult and rejoicing will 
pass into the ocean, the father of all streams ? 

There are not wanting Indian thinkers who look upon the 
whole of Indian philosophy as one system of continuous 
revelation. They believe that each civilisation is working 
out some divine thought which is natural to it. a There is 

i Cf. " This claim of a new thing to be old is, in varying degrees, a 
common characteristic of great movements. The Reformation professed to 
be a return to the Bible, the Evangelical movement in England a return 
to the Gospels, the High Church movement a return to the Early Church. 
A large element even in the French Revolution, the greatest of all breaches 
with the past, had for its ideal a return to Roman republican virtue or to 
the simplicity of the natural man ” (Gilbert Murray, Four Stages of Greek 
Religion, p. 58).

48 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

an immanent teleology which shapes the life of each human 
race towards some complete development. The several 
views set forth in India are considered to be the branches 
of the self-same tree. The short cuts and blind alleys are 
somehow reconciled with the main road of advance to the 
truth. A familiar way in which the six orthodox systems 
are reconciled is to say that just as a mother in pointing out 
the moon to the baby speaks of it as the shining circle at the 
top of the tree, which is quite intelligible to the child, without 
mentioning the immense distance separating the earth from 
the moon which would have bewildered it, even so are 
different views given to suit the varying weakness of human 
understanding. Tire Prabodhacandrodaya, a philosophic 
drama, states that the six systems of Hindu philosophy 
are not mutually exclusive, but establish from various points 
of view the glory of the same uncreate God. They together 
form the living focus of the scattered rays that the 
many-faceted humanity reflects from the splendid sun. 
Madhava’s Sarvadarsanasamgraha (a.d. 1380) sketches 
sixteen systems of thought so as to exhibit a gradually 
ascending series, culminating in the Advaita Vedanta (or 
non-dualism). In the spirit of Hegel, he looks upon the history 
of Indian philosophy as a progressive effort towards a fully 
articulated conception of the world. The truth is unfolded 
bit by bit in the successive systems, and complete truth is 
reflected only when the series of philosophies is completed. 
In the Advaita Vedanta are the many lights brought to 
a single focus. Vijnanabhiksu, the sixteenth -century 
theologian and thinker, holds that all systems are authori- 
tative, 1 and reconciles them by distinguishing practical 
from metaphysical truth, and looks upon Samkhya as the 
final expression of truth. Madhusudana Sarasvati in his 
Prasthanabheda writes : " The ultimate scope of all the 
munis, authors of these different systems, is to support the 
theory of maya, and their only design is to establish the 
existence of one supreme God, the sole essence, for these 
munis could not be mistaken, since they were omniscient. 
But as they saw that men, addicted to the pursuit of external 
objects, could not all at once penetrate into the highest 
1 Sarvagainaprarr.apya.

49 


truths, they held out to them a variety of theories in order 
that they might not fall into atheism. Misunderstanding 
the object which the munis thus had in view, and representing 
that they even designed to propound doctrines contrary 
to the Vedas, men have come to regard the specific doctrines 
of these several schools with preference, and thus became 
adherents of a variety of systems.” 1 This reconciliation of 
the several systems, 1 is attempted by almost all the critics 
and commentators. The difference is only about what they 
regard as the truth. Defenders of Nyaya like Udayana 
look upon Nyaya, and theists like Ramanuja consider 
theism to be the truth. It is in accordance with the spirit 
of Indian culture to think that the several currents of thought 
flowing in its soil will discharge their waters into the one river 
whose flood shall make for the City of God. 

From the beginning the Indian felt that truth was many- 
sided, and different views contained different aspects of truth 
which no one could fully express. He was therefore tolerant 
and receptive of other views. He was fearless in accepting 
even dangerous doctrines so long as they were backed up 
by logic. He would not allow to die, if he could help it, 
one jot or tittle of the tradition, but would try to accommodate 
it all. Several cases of such tolerant treatment we shall 
meet with in the course of our study. Of course there are 
dangers incident to such a breadth of view. Often it has 
led the Indian thinkers into misty vagueness, lazy acceptance 
and cheap eclecticism.

Some Charges Against Indian Philosophy 

The main charges against Indian philosophy are those of 
pessimism, dogmatism, indifference to ethics and unpro- 
gressiveness. 

Almost every critic of Indian philosophy and culture 
harps on its pessimism. 3 We cannot, however, understand

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


how the human mind can speculate freely and remodel life 
when it is filled with weariness and overcome by a feeling 
of hopelessness. A priori, the scope and freedom of Indian 
thought are inconsistent with an ultimate pessimism Indian 
philosophy is pessimistic if by pessimism is meant a sense 
of dissatisfaction with what is or exists. In this sense 
all philosophy is pessimistic. The suffering of the world 
provokes the problems of philosophy and religion. Systems 
of religion which emphasise redemption seek for an escape 
from life as we live it on earth. But reality in its essence 
is not evil. In Indian philosophy the same word “ sat ” 
indicates both reality and perfection. Truth and goodness, 
or more accurately reality and perfection, go together. The 
real is also the supremely valuable, and this is the basis of 
all optimism. Professor Bosanquet writes : “ I believe in 
optimism, but I add that no optimism is worth its salt that 
does not go all the way with pessimism and arrive at a point 
beyond it. This, I am convinced, is the true spirit of life ; 
and if any one thinks it dangerous, and an excuse for un- 
justifiable acquiescence in evil, I reply that all truth which 
has any touch of thoroughness has its danger for practice.” 1 
Indian thinkers are pessimistic in so far as they look upon 
the world order as an evil and a lie ; they are optimistic since 
they feel that there is a way out of it into the realm of truth, 
which is also goodness. 

Indian philosophy, it is said, is nothing if not dogmatic, and 
true philosophy cannot subsist with the acceptance of dogma. 
The course of our study of Indian thought will be an answer 
to this charge. Many of the systems of philosophy discuss 
the problem of knowledge, its origin, and validity as a 
preliminary to a study of other problems. It is true that the 
Veda or the sruti is generally considered to be an authoritative 
source of knowledge. But a philosophy becomes dogmatic 
only if the assertions of the Veda are looked upon as superior 
to the evidence of the senses and the conclusions of reason. 


* Soual and International Ideals, p. 43. Cf. Schopenhauer: "Optimism, 
when it is not merely the thoughtless talk of such as harbour nothing but 
words under their low foreheads, appears not merely as an absurd but 
also as a really wicked way of thinking, as a bitter mockery of the 
unspeakable suffering humanity.”

The Vedic statements are aptavacana, or sayings of the 
wise, which we are called upon to accept, if we feel convinced 
that those wise had better means than we have of forming 
a judgment on the matter in question. Generally, these 
Vedic truths refer to the experiences of the seers, which any 
rational rendering of reality must take into account. These 
intuitional experiences are within the possibility of all men 
if only they will to have them. 1 The appeal to the Vedas 
does not involve any reference to an extra-philosophical 
standard. What is dogma to the ordinary man is experience 
to the pure in heart. It is true that when we reach the 
stage of the later commentaries we have a state of philoso- 
phical orthodoxy, when speculation becomes an academic 
defence of accepted dogmas. The earlier systems also call 
themselves exegetical and profess to be commentaries on 
the old texts, but they never tended to become scholastic, 
since the Upanisads to which they looked for inspiration 
were many-sided * After the eighth century philosophical 
controversy became traditional and scholastic in character, 
and we miss the freedom of the earlier era. The founders 
of the schools are canonised, and so questioning their opinions 
is little short of sacrilege and impiety. The fundamental 
propositions are settled once for all, and the function of the 
teacher is only to transmit the beliefs of the school with such 
changes as his brain can command and the times require. 
We have fresh arguments for foregone conclusions, new 
expedients to meet new difficulties and a re-establishment 
of the old with a little change of front or twist of dialectic 
There is less of meditation on the deep problems of life and 
more of discussion of the artificial ones. The treasure that 
is the tradition clogs us with its own burdensome wealth, 
and philosophy ceases to move and sometimes finds it hard 
to breathe at all. The charge of unprofitableness urged in 
general against the whole of Indian philosophy may have 
some point when applied to the wordy disquisitions of the 
commentators who are not the inspired apostles of life and 
beauty which the older generation of philosophers were, 
but professional dialecticians conscious of their mission 
to mankind. Yet even under the inevitable crust of age the

soul remains young, and now and then breaks through and 
sprouts into something green and tender. There arise men 
like fsamkara or Madhava, who call themselves commentators, 
and yet perceive the spiritual principle which directs the 
movements of the world. 

It is often urged against Indian philosophy that it is 
nonethical in character. “ There is practically no ethical 
philosophy within the frontiers of Hindu thinking.” 1 The 
charge, however, cannot be sustained. Attempts to fill the 
whole of life v/ith the power of spirit are common. Next to 
the category of reality, that of dharma is the most important 
concept in Indian thought. So far as the actual ethical 
content is concerned. Buddhism, Jainism and Hinduism 
are not inferior to others. Ethical perfection is the first step 
towards divine knowledge. 

Philosophy in India, it is said, remains stationary and 
represents an endless process of threshing old straw. “ The 
unchanging East ” connotes that in India time has ceased 
to fly and remained motionless for ever. If it means that 
there is a fundamental identity in the problems, then this sort 
of unprogressiveness is a feature common to all philosophical 
developments. The same old problems of God, freedom and 
immortality and the same old unsatisfactory solutions are 
repeated throughout the centuries. While the form of the 
problems is the same, the matter has changed. There is 
all the difference in the world between the God of the Vedic 
hymns drinking soma, and the Absolute of fsamkara. The 
situations to which philosophy is a response renew themselves 
in each generation, and the effort to deal with them needs 
a corresponding renewal. If the objection means that there 
is not much fundamental difference between the solutions 
given in the ancient scriptures of India and Plato’s works 
or Christian writings, it only show's that the same loving 
universal Spirit has been uttering its message and making 
its voice heard from time to time. The sacred themes come 
down to us through the ages variously balanced and coloured 
by race and tradition. If it means that there is a certain 
reverence for the past which impels the Indian thinkers to pour 
new wine into old bottles, we have already said that this

is a characteristic of the Indian mind. The way to grow is to 
take in all the good that has gone before and add to it some- 
thing more. It is to inherit the faith of the fathers and 
modify it by the spirit of the time. If Indian thought is 
said to be futile because it did not take into account the 
progress of the sciences, it is the futility which all old things 
possess in the eyes of the new. The scientific developments 
have not brought about as great a change in the substance 
of philosophy as this criticism assumes. The theories so 
revolutionary in their scientific aspects as the biological 
evolution and the physical relativity have not upset estab- 
lished philosophies, but only confirmed them from fresh fields. 

The charge of unprogressiveness or stationariness holds 
when we reach the stage after the first great commentators. 
The hand of the past grew heavy, initiative was curbed, and 
the work of the scholastics, comparable to that of the 
mediaeval Schoolmen, with the same reverence for authority 
and tradition and the same intrusion of theological prejudice, 
began. The Indian philosopher could have done better 
with greater freedom. To continue the living development 
of philosophy, to keep the current of creative energy flowing, 
contact with the living movements of the world capable 
of promoting real freedom of thought is necessary. Perhaps 
the philosophy of India which lost its strength and vigour 
when her political fortunes met with defeat may derive 
fresh inspiration and a new impulse from the era just dawning 
upon her. If the Indian thinkers combine a love of what is 
old with a thirst for what is true, Indian philosophy may yet 
have a future as glorious as its past.

Value of the Study of Indian Philosophy 

It is not merely as a piece of antiquarian investigation 
that Indian thought deserves study. Speculations of 
particular thinkers or the ideas of a past age are not without 
value. Nothing that has ever interested men and women 
can ever wholly lose its vitality. In the thought of the 
Vedic Aryans we witness the wrestlings of powerful minds 



54 


INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


with the highest problems set to thinking man. In the 
words of Hegel : “ The history of philosophy in its true 
meaning deals not with the past, but with the eternal and 
veritable present ; and in its results resembles, not a museum 
of aberrations of the human intellect, but a pantheon of 
Godlike figures representing various stages of the immanent 
logic of all human thought.” 1 The history of Indian thought 
is not what it seems at first sight, a mere succession of ghostly 
ideas which follow one another in rapid succession. 

It is easy to make sport of philosophy, since to those 
who are content to live among the things of sense and think 
in a slovenly way, philosophic problems wear a look of 
unreality, and possess a flavour of absurdity. The hostile 
critic looks upon the disputes of philosophy as wasteful 
logic-chopping and intellectual legerdemain concerned with 
such conundrums as “ Did the hen come first or the egg ? ” a 
The problems discussed in Indian philosophy have perplexed 
men from the beginning of time, though they have never 
been solved to the satisfaction of all. There seems to be 
an essential human need or longing to know the nature of 
soul and God. Every thinking man, when he reflects on the 
fact that he is swept without pause along the great curve of 
birth to death, the rising flood of life, the ceaseless stream 
of becoming, which presses ever onward and upward, cannot 
but ask, What is the purpose of it all, as a whole, apart from 
the little distracting incidents of the way ? Philosophy 
is no racial idiosyncrasy of India, but a human interest. 

If we lay aside professional philosophy, which may well 
be a futile business, we have in India one of the best logical 
developments of thought. The labours of the Indian thinkers 
are so valuable to the advancement of human knowledge 
that we judge their work to be worthy of study, even if we 
find manifest errors in it. If the sophisms which ruined the 
philosophies of the past are any reason for neglecting them, 
then not only the study of Indian philosophy but of all 
philosophy should be given up. After all, the residuum 
of permanent truth which may be acknowledged as the

effective contribution to human thought even with regard 
to the most illustrious thinkers of the West, like Plato and 
Aristotle, is not very great. It is easy to smile at the exquisite 
rhapsodies of Plato or the dull dogmatism of Descartes or 
the arid empiricism of Hume or the bewildering paradoxes of 
Hegel, and yet withal there is no doubt that we profit by 
the study of their works. Even so, though only a few of 
the vital truths of Indian thinkers have moulded the history 
of the human mind, yet there are general syntheses, systematic 
conceptions put forward by a Badarayana or a fSariikara 
which will remain landmarks of human thought and 
monuments of human genius . 1 

To the Indian student a study of Indian philosophy 
alone can give a right perspective about the past of India. 
At the present day the average Hindu looks upon his past 
systems, Buddhism, Advaitism, Dvaitism, as all equally 
worthy and acceptable to reason. The authors of the systems 
are worshipped as divine. A study of Indian philosophy 
will conduce to the clearing up of the situation, the adopting 
of a more balanced outlook and the freeing of the mind from 
the oppressing sense of the perfection of everything that is 
ancient. This freedom from bondage to authority is an ideal 
worth striving at. For when the enslaved intellect is freed, 
original thinking and creative effort might again be possible. 
It may be a melancholy satisfaction to the present day Indian 

1 Many scholars of the West recognise the value of Indian philosophy. 
“ On the other hand, when we read with attention the poetical and philoso- 
phical movements of the East, above all those of India, which are beginning 
to spread in Europe, we discover there so many truths, and truths so pro- 
found, and which make such a contrast with the meanness of the results 
at which the European genius has sometimes stopped, that we are con- 
strained to bend the knee before that of the East, and to see in this cradle 
of the human race the native land of the highest philosophy ” (Victor 
Cousin). “ If I were to ask myself from what literature, we here in Europe, 
we who have been nurtured almost exclusively on the thoughts of Greeks 
and Romans, and of one Semitic race, the Jewish, may draw that corrective 
which is most wanted, in order to make our inner life more perfect, more 
comprehensive, more universal, in fact more truly human, a life, not for 
this life only, but a transfigured and eternal life — again, I should point to 
India ” (Max Muller). “ Among nations possessing indigenous philosophy 
and metaphysics, together with an innate relish for these pursuits, such 
as at present characterises Germany, and in olden times was the proud 
distinction of Greece, Hindustan holds the first rank in point of time "

V 

Periods of Indian Thought 

It is necessary to give some justification for the title 
" Indian Philosophy,” when we are discussing the philosophy 
of the Hindus as distinct from that of the other communities 
which have also their place in India. The most obvious 
reason is that of common usage. India even to-day is mainly 
Hindu. And we are concerned here with the history of 
Indian thought up till a.d. iooo or a little after, when the 
fortunes of the Hindus became more and more linked with 
those of the non-Hindus. 

To the continuous development of Indian thought different 
peoples at different ages have brought their gifts, yet the 
force of the Indian spirit had its own shaping influence on 
them. It is not possible for us to be sure of the exact chrono- 
logical development, though we shall try to view Indian 
thought from the historical point of view. The doctrines 
of particular schools are relative to their environment and 
have to be viewed together. Otherwise, they will cease to 
have any living interest for us and become dead traditions. 
Each system of philosophy is an answer to a positive question 
which its age has put to itself, and when viewed from its own 
angle of vision will be seen to contain some truth. The philo- 
sophies are not sets of propositions conclusive or mistaken, 
but the expression and evolution of a mind with which and 
in which we must live if we wish to know how the systems 
shaped themselves. We must recognise the solidarity of 
philosophy with history, of intellectual life with the social 
conditions . 1 The historical method requires us not to take 

1 In the image of Walter Pater. “ As the strangely twisted pine-tree, 
which would be a freak of nature on an English lawn, is seen, if we replace 
it in thought, amid the contending forces of the Alpine torrent that actually 
shaped its growth, to have been the creature of necessity, of the logic of 
certain facts, even so the most fantastic beliefs will assume their natural 
propriety when they are duly correlated with the conditions round them 
of which they are in truth a part ’’ ( Plato and Platonism, p. io). 



INTRODUCTION 57 

sides in the controversy of schools, but follow the development 
with strict indifference. 

While we are keenly alive to the immense importance 
of historical perspective, we regret that on account of the 
almost entire neglect of the chronological sequences of the 
Writings it is not possible for us to determine exactly the 
relative dates of the systems. So unhistorical, or perhaps 
so ultra-philosophical, was the nature of the ancient Indian, 
that we know more about the philosophies than about the 
philosophers. From the time of the birth of Buddha Indian 
chronology is on a better foundation. The rise of Buddhism 
was contemporaneous with the extension of the Persian power 
to the Indus under the dynasty of Achaemenidse in Persia. 
It is said to be the source of the earliest knowledge of India 
in the West obtained by Hecateus and Herodotus. 

The following are the broad divisions of Indian philosophy : 
(i) The Vedic Period (1500 B.C.-600 B.c.) covers the age of 
the settlement of the Aryans and the gradual expanison 
and spread of the Aryan culture and civilisation. It was 
the time which witnessed the rise of the forest universities, 
where were evolved the beginnings of the sublime idealism 
of India. We discern in it successive strata of thought, 
signified by the Mantras or the hymns, the Brahmanas, and 
the Upanisads. The views put forward in this age are not 
philosophical in the technical sense of the term. It is the 
age of groping, where superstition and thought are yet in 
conflict. Yet to give order and continuity to the subject, 
it is necessary for us to begin with an account of the outlook 
of the hymns of the Rg-Veda and discuss the views of the 
Upanisads. 

(2) The Epic Period (600 B.c. to a.d. 200) extends over 
the development between the early Upanisads and the 
darsanas or the systems of philosophy. The epics of the 
Ramayana and the Mahabharata serve as the vehicles 
through which was conveyed the new message of the heroic 
and the godly in human relations. In this period we have 
also the great democratisation of the Upanisad ideas in 
Buddhism and the Bhagavadglta. The religious systems 
of Buddhism, Jainism, Saivism, Vaisnavism belong to this 
age. The development of abstract thought which culminated 



58 


INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


in the schools of Indian philosophy, the darsanas, belongs 
to this period. Most of the systems had their early begin- 
nings about the period of the rise of Buddhism, and they 
developed side by side through many centuries; yet the 
systematic works of the schools belong to a later age. 

(3) The Sutra Period (from A.D. 200) comes next. The 
mass of material grew so unwieldy that it was found necessary 
to devise a shorthand scheme of philosophy. This reduction 
and summarisation occurred in the form of Sutras. These 
Sutras are unintelligible without commentaries, so much so 
that the latter have become more important than the Sutras 
themselves. Here we have the critical attitude in philosophy 
developed. In the preceding periods we have philosophical 
discussions, no doubt, where the mind did not passively 
receive whatever it was told, but played round the subject, 
raising objections and answering them. By happy intuition 
the thinkers pitch upon some general principles which seem 
to them to explain all aspects of the universe. The philoso- 
phical syntheses, however profound and acute they may 
be, suffered throughout from the defect of being pre-critical, 
in the Kantian sense of the term. Without a previous 
criticism of the human capacity to solve philosophical 
problems, the mind looked at the world and reached its 
conclusions. The earlier efforts to understand and interpret 
the world were not strictly philosophical attempts, since 
they were not troubled by any scruples about the com- 
petence of the human mind or the efficiency of the instru- 
ments and the criteria employed. As Caird puts it, mind 
was “ too busy with the object to attend to itself.” 1 So 
when we come to the Sutras we have thought and reflection 
become self-conscious, and not merely constructive imagina- 
tion and religious freedom. Among the systems themselves, 
we cannot say definitely which are earlier and which later. 
There are cross-references throughout. The Yoga accepts 
the Samkhya, the Vaisesika recognises both the Nyaya 
and the Sarnkhya. Nyaya refers to the Vedanta and the 
Samkhya. Mimamsa directly or indirectly recognises the 
pre-existence of all others. So does the Vedanta. Professor 
Garbe holds that the Samkhya is the oldest school. Next

came Yoga, next Mlmaiiisa and Vedanta, and last of all 
Vaisesika and Nyaya. The Sutra period cannot be sharply 
distinguished from the scholastic period of the commentators. 
The two between them extend up till the present day. 

(4) The Scholastic Period also dates from the second 
century a.d. It is not possible for us to draw a hard and 
fast line between this and the previous one. Yet it is to this 
that the great names of Kumarila, Samkara, £ridhara, Rama- 
nuja, Madhva, Vacaspati, Udayana, Bhaskara, Jayanta, 
Vijnanabhiksu and Raghunatha belong. The literature soon 
becomes grossly polemical. We find a brood of schoolmen, 
noisy controversialists indulging in over-subtle theories 
and fine-spun arguments, who fought fiercely over the nature 
of logical universals. Many Indian scholars dread opening 
their tomes which more often confuse than enlighten us. 
None would deny their acuteness and enthusiasm. Instead 
of thought we find words, instead of philosophy logic-chopping . 
Obscurity of thought, subtlety of logic, intolerance of 
disposition, mark the worst type of the commentators. The 
better type, of course, are quite as valuable as the ancient 
thinkers themselves. Commentators like Sarhkara and 
Ramanuja re-state the old doctrine, and their restatement 
is just as valuable as a spiritual discovery. 

There are some histories of Indian philosophy written 
by Indian thinkers. Almost all later commentators from 
their own points of view discuss other doctrines. In that 
way every commentator happens to give an idea of the other 
views. Sometimes conscious attempts are made to deal 
with the several systems in a continuous manner. Some 
of the chief of these " historical ” accounts may here be 
mentioned. Saddarsanasamuccaya, or the epitome of 
the six systems, is the name of a work by Haribhadra. 1 

1 Mr. Barth says : " Haribhadra, who according to tradition died in 
a.d. 529, but by more exact testimony lived in the ninth century, and who 
had several homonyms, was a Brahmin converted to Jainism. He is famous 
still as the author of Fourteen Hundred Prabandhas (chapters of works), 
and seems to have been one of the first to introduce the Sanskrit language 
into the scholastic literature of the Svetambara Jains. By the six systems 
the Brahmins understand the two MImamsas, the Samkhya and the Yoga, 
the Ny 5 ya and the Vai£e§ika. Haribhadra, on the other hand, expounds 
under this title very curtly in eighty-seven slokas, but quite impartially, the 
essential principles of the Buddhists, the Jainas, the followers of the Nyaya,

60 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

Samantabhadra, a Digambara Jain of the sixth century, is 
said to have written a work called Aptamimamsa, containing 
a review of the various philosophical schools. 1 A Madhya- 
mika Buddhist, by name Bhavaviveka, is reputed to be the 
author of a work called Tarkaj vala, a criticism of the Mimamsa, 
Samkhya, Vaisesika and Vedanta schools. A Digambara 
Jain, by name Vidyananda, in his Astasahasri, and another 
Digambara, by name Merutunga, in his work on Saddarsana- 
vicara (1300 a.d.) are said to have criticised the Hindu 
systems. The most popular account of Indian philosophy 
is the Sarvadarsanasamgraha, by the well-known Vedantin 
Madhavacarya, who lived in the fourteenth century in 
South India. The Sarvasiddhantasarasamgraha assigned to 
Sarhkara, 2 and the Prasthananabheda by Madhusudana 
Sarasvatl ,3 contain useful accounts of the different 
philosophies. 

the Samkhya, the Vaisesika and the MImamssi. He thus selects his own school 
and those with whom the Jainas had the closest affinities, and puts them 
in between the schools of their greatest enemies, the Buddhists and the 
ritualists of the school of Jaimini. These last he couples with the Loka- 
yatikas, the atheistic materialists, not simply from sectarian fanaticism 
and on his own judgment, but following an opinion that was then prevalent 
even among the Brahmins ” (Indian Antiquary, p. 66, 1895).

The Vedas 

The Vedas are the earliest documents of the human mind 
that we possess. Wilson writes : ‘‘When the texts of the 
Rg and Yajur Vedas are completed, we shall be in the 
possession of materials sufficient for the safe appreciation 
of the results to be derived from them, and of the actual 
condition of the Hindus, both political and religious, at a 
date co-eval with that of the yet earliest known records of 
social organisation — long anterior to the dawn of Grecian 
civilisation — prior to the oldest vestiges of the Assyrian 
Empire yet discovered — contemporary probably with the 
oldest Hebrew writings, and posterior only to the Egyptian 
dynasties, of which, however, we yet know little except 
barren names; the Vedas give us abundant information 



64 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

respecting all that is most interesting in the contem- 
plation of antiquity.” 1 There are four Vedas: Rg, Yajur, 
Sama and Atharva. The first three agree not only in 
their name, form and language, but in their contents also. 
Of them all the Rg-Veda is the chief. The inspired songs 
which the Aryans brought with them from their earlier home 
into India as their most precious possession were collected, 
it is generally held, in response to a prompting to treasure 
them up which arose when the Aryans met with large num- 
bers of the worshippers of other gods in their new country. 
The Rg-Veda is that collection. The Sama-Veda is a purely 
liturgical collection. Much of it is found in the Rg-Veda, 
and even those hymns peculiar to it have no distinctive 
lessons of their own. They are all arranged for being sung 
at sacrifices. The Yajur-Veda, like the Sama, also serves a 
liturgical purpose. This collection was made to meet the 
demands of a ceremonial religion. Whitney writes : “ In 
the early Vedic times the sacrifice was still, in the main, 
an unfettered act of devotion, not committed to the charge 
of a body of privileged priests, not regulated in its minor 
details, but left to the free impulses of him who offered it, 
accompanied with Rg and Sama hymns and chants, that 
the mouth of the offerer might not be silent while his 
hands were presenting to the divinity the gift which his 
heart prompted. ... As in process of time, however, the 
ritual assumed a more and more formal character, becoming 
finally a strictly and minutely regulated succession of single 
actions, not only were the verses fixed which were to be 
quoted during the ceremony, but there established them- 
selves likewise a body of utterances, formulas of words, 
intended to accompany each individual action of the whole 
work to explain, excuse, bless, give it a symbolical signifi- 
cance or the like. . . . These sacrificial formulas received 
the name of Yajus, from the root Yaj, to sacrifice. . . . 
The Yajur-Veda is made up of these formulas, partly in 
prose and partly in verse, arranged in the order in which 
they were to be made use of at the sacrifice.” 3 The collec- 
tions of the Sama and the Yajur Vedas must have been

THE HYMNS OF THE RG-VEDA 65 

made in the interval between the Rg-Vedic collection 
and the Brahmanical period, when the ritualistic religion 
was well established. The Atharva-Veda for a long time 
was without the prestige of a Veda, though for our purposes 
it is next in importance only to the Rg-Veda, for, like it, 
it is an historical collection of independent contents. A 
different spirit pervades this Veda, which is the produc- 
tion of a later era of thought. It shows the result of 
the compromising spirit adopted by the Vedic Aryans in 
view of the new gods and goblins worshipped by the 
original peoples of the country whom they were slowly 
subduing. 

Each Veda consists of three parts known as Mantras, 
Brahmanas and Upanisads. The collection of the mantras 
or the hymns is called the Samhita. The Brahmanas 
include the precepts and religious duties. The Upanisads 
and the Aranyakas are the concluding portions of the 
Brahmanas which discuss philosophical problems. The 
Upanisads contain the mental background of the whole 
of the subsequent thought of the country. Of the early 
Upanisads Aitareya and Kausltaki belong to the Rg, 
Kena and Chandogya to the Sama, Isa and Taittiriya and 
the Brhadaranyaka to the Yajur, and Prasna and Mundaka 
to the Atharva-Veda. The Aranyakas come between the 
Brahmanas and the Upanisads, and, as their name implies, 
are intended to serve as objects of meditation for those who 
live in forests. The Brahmanas discuss the ritual to be 
observed by the householder, but when in his old age he 
resorts to the forests, some substitute for ritual is needed, 
and that is supplied in the Aranyakas. The symbolic and 
spiritual aspects of the sacrificial cult are meditated upon, 
and this meditation takes the place of the performance of 
the sacrifice. The Aranyakas form the transition link 
between the ritual of the Brahmanas and the philosophy 
of the Upanisads. While the hymns are the creation of 
the poets , 1 the Brahmanas are the work of the priests, and 
the Upanisads the meditations of the philosophers. The 
religion of nature of the hymns, the religion of law of the 
Brahmanas and the religion of spirit of the Upanisads, 

« R.V., i. 1G4. 6. ; x. 129. 4.

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


correspond in a very close way to the three great divisions 
in the Hegelian conception of the development of religion. 
Though at a later stage the three have existed side by 
side, there is no doubt that they were originally developed 
in successive periods. The Upanisads, while in one sense 
a continuation of the Vedic worship, are in another a pro- 
test against the religion of the Brahmanas. 


II 

Importance of the Study of the Vedic Hymns 

A study of the hymns of the Rg-Veda is indispensable 
for any adequate account of Indian thought. Whatever 
we may think them, half-formed myths or crude allegories, 
obscure gropings or immature compositions, still they are 
the source of the later practices and philosophies of the 
Indo-Aryans, and a study of them is necessary for a proper 
understanding of subsequent thought. We find a freshness 
and simplicity and an inexplicable charm as of the breath 
of the spring or the flower of the morning about these first 
efforts of the human mind to comprehend and express 
the mystery of the world. 

The text of the Veda which we possess has come to us 
from that period of intellectual activity when the Aryans 
found their way into India from their original home. They 
brought with them certain notions and beliefs which were 
developed and continued on the Indian soil. A long 
interval must have elapsed between the composition and 
the compilation of these hymns. Max Muller divides the 
Samhita period into the two called the Chandas and the 
Mantra periods . 1 In the former the hymns were com- 
posed. It was the creative epoch characterised by real 
poetry, when men’s emotions poured themselves out in 
songs ; we have then no traces of sacrifices. Prayer was 
the only offering made to the gods. The second is the 
period of collection or systematic grouping. It was then 

* Attempts are sometimes made to assign the hymns to five different 
periods marked by differences of religious belief and social custom. See 
Arnold: Vedic Metre. 



THE HYMNS OF THE RG-VEDA 


67 


that the hymns were arranged in practically the same form 
in which we have them at present. In this period sacri- 
ficial ideas slowly developed. When exactly the hymns 
were composed and collected is a matter of conjecture. 
We are sure that they were current some fifteen centuries 
before Christ. Buddhism, which began to spread in India 
about 500 b.c., presupposes not only the existence of the 
Vedic hymns but the whole Vedic literature, including the 
Brahmanas and the Upanisads. For the sacrificial system 
of the Brahmanas to become well established, for the 
philosophy of the Upanisads to be fully developed, it 
would require a long period. 1 The development of thought 
apparent in this vast literature requires at least a millen- 
nium. This is not too long a period if we remember the 
variety and growth which the literature displays. Some 
Indian scholars assign the Vedic hymns to 3000 B.C., others 
to 6000 B.c. The late Mr. Tilak dates the hymns about 
4500 B.c., the Brahmanas 2500 B.C., the early Upanisads 
1600 B.c. Jacobi puts the hymns at 4500 B.c. We assign 
them to the fifteenth century b.c. and trust that our date 
will not be challenged as being too early. 

The Rg-Veda Sarhhita or collection consists of 1,017 
hymns or suktas, covering a total of about 10,600 stanzas. 
It is divided into eight astakas, 2 each having eight adhyayas, 
or chapters, which are further subdivided into vargas or 
groups. It is sometimes divided into ten mandalas or 
circles. The latter is the more popular division. The 
first mandala contains 191 hymns, and is ascribed roughly 
to fifteen different authors or Rsis (seers or sages) such 
as Gautama, Kanva, etc. In the arrangement of the 
hymns there is a principle involved. Those addressed to 
Agni come first, those to Indra second, and then the rest. 
Each of the next six mandalas is ascribed to a single family 
of poets, and has the same arrangement. In the eighth we 
have no definite order. It is ascribed like the first to a 
number of different authors. Mandala nine consists of 
hymns addressed to Soma. Many of the hymns of the eighth

Brahman, Atman, Yoga, Mimamsa, are derived.

and ninth Mandalas are found in the Sama-Veda also. 
Mandala ten seems to be a later appendage. At any rate, 
it contains views current at the last period of the develop- 
ment of the Vedic hymns. Here the native hue of the 
earlier devotional poetry is sicklied over with the pale 
cast of philosophic thought. Speculative hymns about the 
origin of creation, etc., are to be met with. Together 
with these abstract theorisings are also found in it the 
superstitious charms and exorcisings belonging to the 
Atharva-Veda period. While the speculative parts indi- 
cate the maturing of the mind which first revealed itself 
in the lyrical hymns, this feature shows that by that time 
the Vedic Aryans must have grown familiar with the 
doctrines and practices of the native Indians, and both 
these are clear indications of the late origin of the tenth 
book. 


Ill 

The Teaching of the Vedas 

Different views of the spirit of the Vedic hymns are 
held by competent scholars who have made these ancient 
scriptures their life study. Pfleiderer speaks of the “ pri- 
maeval child-like naive prayer of Rg-Veda.” Pictet main- 
tains that the Aryans of the Rg-Veda possessed a mono- 
theism, however vague and primitive it might be. Roth 
and Dayananda Sarasvatl, the founder of the Arya Samaj, 
agree with this view. Ram Mohan Roy considers the 
Vedic gods to be “ the allegorical representations of the 
attributes of the supreme Deity.” According to others, 
Bloomfield among them, the hymns of the Rg-Veda are 
sacrificial compositions of a primitive race which attached 
great importance to ceremonial rites. Bergaigne holds 
that they were all allegorical. Sayana, the famous Indian 
commentator, adopts the naturalistic interpretation of the 
gods of the hymns, which is supported by modern Euro- 
pean scholarship. Sayana sometimes interprets the hymns 
in the spirit of the later Brahmanic religion. These vary- 
ing opinions need not be looked upon as antagonistic to 
one another, for they only point to the heterogeneous 



69 


THE HYMNS OF THE RG-VEDA 

nature of the Rg-Veda collection. It is a work repre- 
senting the thought of successive generations of thinkers, 
and so contains within it different strata of thought. In 
the main, we may say that the Rg-Veda represents the 
religion of an unsophisticated age. The great mass of the 
hymns are simple and naive, expressing the religious con- 
sciousness of a mind yet free from the later sophistication. 
There are also hymns which belong to the later formal 
and conventional age of the Brahmanas. There are some, 
especially in the last book, which embody the mature 
results of conscious reflection on the meaning of the world 
and man’s place in it. Monotheism characterises some of 
the hymns of the Rg-Veda. There is no doubt that some- 
times the several gods were looked upon as the different 
names and expressions of the Universal Being . 1 But this 
monotheism is not as yet the trenchant clear-cut mono- 
theism of the modern world. 

Mr. Aurobindo Ghosh, the great Indian scholar-mystic, 
is of opinion that the Vedas are replete with suggestions 
of secret doctrines and mystic philosophies. He looks 
upon the gods of the hymns as symbols of the psycho- 
logical functions. Surya signifies intelligence, Agni will, 
and Soma feeling. The Veda to him is a mystery religion 
corresponding to the Orphic and Eleusinian creeds of 
ancient Greece. “ The hypothesis I propose is that the 
Rg-Veda is itself the one considerable document that 
remains to us from the early period of human thought of 
which the historical Eleusinian and Orphic mysteries were 
the failing remnants, when the spiritual and psychological 
knowledge of the race was concealed for reasons now diffi- 
cult to determine, in a veil of concrete and material figures 
and symbols which protected the sense from the profane 
and revealed it to the initiated. One of the leading princi- 
ples of the mystics was the sacredness and secrecy of self- 
knowledge and the true knowledge of the gods. This 
wisdom was, they thought, unfit for, perhaps even dangerous, 
to the ordinary human mind, or in any case liable to perver- 
sion and misuse and loss of virtue if revealed to vulgar and 
unpurified spirits. Hence they favoured the existence of

70 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

an outer worship effective but imperfect for the profane, 
and an inner discipline for the initiate, and clothed their 
language in words and images which had equally a spiritual 
sense for the elect and a concrete sense for the mass of 
ordinary worshippers. The Vedic hymns were conceived 
and constructed on these principles.” 1 When we find 
that this view is opposed not only to the modern views 
of European scholars but also to the traditional interpre- 
tations of Sayana and the system of Purva-Mimamsa, the 
authority on Vedic interpretation, we must hesitate to 
follow the lead of Mr. Aurobindo Ghosh, however ingenious 
his point of view may be. It is not likely that the whole 
progress of Indian thought has been a steady falling away 
from the highest spiritual truths of the Vedic hymns. It 
is more in accordance with what is known of the general 
nature of human development, and easier to concede that 
the later religions and philosophies arose out of the crude 
suggestions and elementary moral ideas and spiritual aspira- 
tions of the early mind, than that they were a degradation 
of an original perfection. 

In interpreting the spirit of the Vedic hymns we pro- 
pose to adopt the view of them accepted by the Brahmanas 
and the Upanisads, which came immediately after. These 
later works are a continuation and a development of the 
views of the hymns. While we find the progress from the 
worship of outward nature powers to the spiritual religion 
of the Upanisads easily intelligible according to the law 
of normal religious growth — man everywhere on earth 
starts with the external and proceeds to the internal — the 
Upanisads do not care for the early nature worship, but 
only develop the suggestions of the highest religion con- 
tained in the Vedas. This interpretation is in entire har- 
mony with the modem historical method and the scientific 
theory of early human culture, and accords well with the 
classic Indian view as put forth by Sayana.

IV 

Philosophical Tendencies 

In the Rg-Veda we have the impassioned utterances 
of primitive but poetic souls which seek some refuge from 
the obstinate questionings of sense and outward things. 
The hymns are philosophical to the extent that they 
attempt to explain the mysteries of the world not by means 
of any superhuman insight or extraordinary revelation, but 
by the light of unaided reason. The mind revealed in the 
Vedic hymns is not of any one type. There were poetic 
souls who simply contemplated the beauties of the sky 
and the wonders of the earth, and eased their musical souls 
of their burden by composing hymns. The Indo-Iranian 
gods of Dyaus, Varuna, Usas, Mitra, etc., were the pro- 
ductions of this poetic consciousness. Others of a more 
active temperament tried to adjust the world to their own 
purposes. Knowledge of the world was useful to them as 
the guide of life. And in the period of conquest and battle, 
such useful utilitarian deities as Indr a were conceived. 
The genuine philosophical impulse, the desire to know 
and understand the world for its own sake, showed itself 
only at the end of this period of storm and stress. It was 
then that men sat down to doubt the gods they ignorantly 
worshipped and reflected on the mysteries of life. It is at 
this period that questions were put to which the mind of 
man could not give adequate answers. The Vedic poet 
exclaims : "I do not know what kind of thing I am ; 
mysterious, bound, my mind wanders.” Even though germs 
of true philosophy appear at a late stage, still the view of 
life reflected in the poetry and practice of the Vedic hymns 
is instructive. As legendary history precedes archaeology, 
alchemy chemistry, and astrology astronomy, even so 
mythology and poetry precede philosophy and science. 
The impulse of philosophy finds its first expression in 
mythology and religion. In them we find the answers to 
the questions of ultimate existence, believed by the people 
in general. These happen to be products of imagination, 



72 


INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


where mythical causes are assumed to account for the 
actual world. As reason slowly gains ascendancy over 
fancy, an attempt is made to distinguish the permanent 
stuff from out of which the actual things of the world are 
made. Cosmological speculations take the place of mythical 
assumptions. The permanent elements of the world are 
deified, and thus cosmology becomes confused with religion. 
In the early stages of reflection as we have them in the 
Rg-Veda, mythology, cosmology and religion are found 
intermixed. It will be of interest to describe briefly the 
views of the hymns under the four heads of theology, 
cosmology, ethics and eschatology. 


V 

Theology 

A religious growth of many centuries cannot be a simple 
and transparent creed admitting of easy definition and 
classification. A striking aspect of the hymns is their 
polytheistic character. A great many gods are named and 
worshipped. Yet some of the hymns shock us by their 
highly abstract philosophising, and from primitive poly- 
theism to systematic philosophy it is a long, long way. 
Three strata of thought can be discerned in the religion 
of the hymns of the Rg-Veda, which are naturalistic 
polytheism, monotheism and monism. 

An important point to be borne in mind in this dis- 
cussion is that the word “ deva ” is so very elusive in its 
nature and is used to indicate many different things. 1 
“ Deva is one who gives to man.” 2 God is deva because 
He gives the whole world. The learned man who imparts 
knowledge to fellow man is also a deva. 3 The sun, the 
moon and the sky are devas because they give light to 
all creation. Father and mother and spiritual guides are

origin — the guardian of the loaf.

THE HYMNS OF THE RG-VEDA 73 

also devas . 1 Even a guest is a deva. We have to take 
into account only that notion of deva which answers at 
least roughly to the modern conception of God. It then 
means bright. 

The process of god-making in the factory of man’s 
mind cannot be seen so clearly anywhere else as in the 
Rg-Veda. We have in it the freshness and splendour of 
the morning of man’s mind still undulled by past custom 
or fixed routine. There is no such thing as a beginning 
in the history of ideas, and we have to start somewhere. 
We may begin with the identification of the Vedic gods 
in some of their aspects with certain forces of nature, and 
point out how they were gradually raised to moral and 
superhuman beings. The earliest seers of the Vedic hymns 
delighted in sights of nature in their own simple uncon- 
scious way. Being essentially of a poetic temperament, 
they saw the things of nature with such intensity of feeling 
and force of imagination that the things became suffused 
with souls. They knew what it was to love nature, and 
be lost in the wonders of dawn and sunrise, those 
mysterious processes which effect a meeting of the soul and 
nature. To them nature was a living presence with which 
they could hold communion. Some glorious aspects of 
nature became the windows of heaven, through which the 
divine looked down upon the godless earth. The moon 
and the stars, the sea and the sky, the dawn and the 
nightfall w'ere regarded as divine. This worship of nature 
as such is the earliest form of Vedic religion. 

Soon cold reflection sets in. An unconscious effort to 
penetrate into the inner nature of things results. Man is 
busy making gods in his own image. The religion of the un- 
developed man, the world over, has been a kind of anthro- 
pomorphism. We cannot acquiesce in the chaos of the 
physical world. We try to understand it in some way 
and arrive at some theory of life with the conviction that 
some hypothesis is better than none. Naturally we pro- 
ject our own volitional agency and explain phenomena by 
their spiritual causes . 1 We interpret all things on the

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


analogy of our own nature and posit wills behind physical 
phenomena. The theory is not to be confused with 
animism, for it does not hold to a universal animation of 
nature. It is a sort of polytheism where striking pheno- 
mena of nature, of which India is so full, are deified. The 
religious instinct reveals itself in this way. In moments 
of deep religious feeling, when man is delivered from some 
imminent peril, or realises his utter dependence on the 
mighty forces of nature, he feels the reality of the presence 
of God. He hears the voice of God in the tempest and 
sees his hand in the stilling of the wave. So late as the 
period of the Stoics we meet with similar conceptions. 
“ The Sun, Moon and Stars and Law and Men who have 
turned into Gods.” 1 It is a good thing that the Vedic 
Aryan had faith in the reality of an unseen world. He 
had no doubt about it. Gods are. Naturalism and anthro- 
pomorphism seem to be the first stages of the Vedic 
religion. 

It is now a commonplace of history that the Vedic 
Aryans and the Iranians descended from the same stock and 
exhibit great affinities and resemblance. They came down 
from their common home into India and the Iran of the 
Zoroastrians, and in that central home they dwelt as one 
undivided race till the necessities of life, want of room, 
the spirit of adventure, obliged them to leave their 
motherland and wander in quest of new fields in different 
directions.* That is why w r e find so many affinities in the 


of its own inhabiting spirit-soul ” {Primitive Culture). In his Natural History 
of Religions, Hume wrote : “ There is a universal tendency among mankind 
to conceive all beings like themselves. . . . The unknown causes which 
continually employ their thoughts, appearing always in the same aspect, 
are all apprehended to be of the same kind or species. Nor is it long before 
we ascribe to them thought and reason and passion, and sometimes even 
the limbs and figures of men."

1 Indians and the Iranians are said to belong to the larger family of 
Indo-Europeans, with their subdivisions of Teutonic, Celtic, Slavonic, Italic, 
Hellenic, Armenian races. From a comparison of the beliefs and practices 
of these people scholars infer a sort of Indo-European religion. Animism 
and magic, ancestor worship and belief in immortality are said to be the 
main elements of the Indo-European religion,# Recent ethnologists, such as 
Ripley, seem to adopt a somewhat different classification of races. Some

ancient religions and philosophical ideas of India and 
Persia. Dr. Mills says : “ The A vesta is nearer the Veda 
than the Veda is to its own epic Sanskrit.” There is an 
underlying continuity of language. When the Aryans 
came to India through the Punjab they found the natives 
of India whom they called Dasyus opposing their free 
advance . 1 These Dasyus were of a dark complexion, 
eating beef and indulging in goblin worship. When the 
Aryans met them they desired to keep themselves aloof 
from them. It is this spirit of exclusiveness born of pride 
of race and superiority of culture that developed into the 
later caste spirit. The anxiety to keep their religion pure 
from contamination led the Aryans to collect together 
their own sacred literature. The word samhita, which 
means “collection,” suggests that the hymns of the 
Rg-Veda were collected at the period when the Aryans and 
the non-Aryans met on the soil of India. We shall begin 
our sketch of the Vedic gods with those Indo-Iranian ones 
held in common by the two sister races before their 
separation. 

The feeling of the incompleteness of this world, the 
weakness of man, the need felt for a higher spirit, a guide, 
a friend, a support on which man could rest, to whom he 
could appeal in distress, is natural to the sick heart of man. 
At that early age nothing could answer to this feeling for 
the infinite so well as the boundless and brilliant firma- 
ment of heaven. The sun and the moon and the stars 

identity the Aryan race with the Teutonic or the Nordic. We have nothing 
to do with these here. The history of Indian thought commences only 
when the Aryans of Central Asia separated themselves into two groups, 
the one making through Afghanistan to India and the other spreading over 
the territory called the Iran. 

1 The details of the wanderings of those who first called themselves 
Aryans cannot be decided with any definiteness from the now available 
data. The Vedic hymns reveal a later stage of social life when Sanskrit 
was a spoken language and the Aryan race was split up into many branches. 
Nor are we prepared to admit that the Dravidians were the aborigines of 
India. The Dravidians seem to have come to India at a much earlier date 
than the Aryans, and had their civilisation well established in India before 
the coming of the Aryans. The Dravidians, it is true, adopted the Aryan 
forms of life, but in their turn they influenced the Aryan civilisation. Th« 
numerous tribes who still inhabit mountainous regions difficult of access 
were perhaps the original inhabitants of India

may change, storms break and clouds roll away, but the 
sky abides for ever. Dyaus 1 * 3 * 5 is not merely an Indo- 
Iranian deity, but an Indo-European one. It survives in 
Greece as Zeus, in Italy as Jupiter (Heavenly Father), 
and among the Teutonic tribes as Tyr and Tyi. Deva 
meant originally bright, and later was applied to all the 
bright ones, the sun, the sky, the stars, the dawn, the 
day, etc. It became a general term connoting the common 
features of all shining ones. The earth also was soon 
deified. Heaven and Earth at the beginning had perhaps only 
the physical aspects of vastness, breadth, productiveness.* 
The attributes ascribed to the Earth are such as “ yielding 
honey,” “ full of milk.” But very early Heaven and Earth 
became endowed with human qualities such as “ not de- 
caying,” " father ” and “ mother.” Moral attributes such as 
beneficence, omniscience and righteousness were also added.3 
It may be that there has been steady advance from the phy- 
sical to the personal and from the personal to the divine. 
Earth and Heaven, the first objects of worship the world over, 
though probably in the beginning they were looked upon as 
independent beings, soon entered into a marriage alliance. The 
Earth was looked upon as the fruitful mother, impregnated 
by Heaven. In the Homeric hymns the Earth is addressed 
as “ Mother of Gods, the wife of the starry Heaven.” 4 
Earth and Heaven are the universal parents who give 
life to all creatures and grant them the means of subsist- 
ence. In the Rg-Veda they are generally addressed in 
the dual number as two beings forming but one concept, 
for all between, the sun, the dawn, the fire, the wind and 
the rain were their offspring. They are the parents of men 
and gods. 5 As the number of gods increased the question 
arose as to who made Heaven and Earth. “ He was 
indeed among the gods the cleverest workman, who 
produced the brilliant ones (Heaven and Earth) that

ones by his wisdom and establishes them on everlasting 
supports.” 1 * This creative power is assigned to Agni, 3 * * 
Indra,3 or Soma.4 Other gods also come in for this 
honour. 5 

Varuna is the god of the sky. The name is derived 
from the root “ var,” to “ cover " or “ compass.” He is 
identical with the Greek Ouranos and the Ahuramazda of 
the Avesta. His physical origin is manifest. He is the 
coverer or the enfolder. He covers the whole starry 
expanse of heaven “ as with a robe, with all the creatures 
thereof and their dwellings.” 6 Mitra is his constant com- 
panion. Varuna and Mitra, when used together, express 
night and day, darkness and light. Varuna’s figure is 
steadily transformed and idealised till he becomes the 
most moral god of the Vedas. He watches over the world, 
punishes the evildoers and forgives the sins of those who 
implore his pardon. The sun is his eye, the sky is his 
garment and the storm is his breath.7 Rivers flow by his 
command 8 ; the sun shines, the star and the moon are in 
their courses for fear of him.9 By his law heaven and earth 
are held apart. He upholds the physical and the moral 
order. He is no capricious god, but a “ dlirtavrata,” one 
of fixed resolve. Other gods obey his orders. He is 
omniscient, and as such knows the flight of the birds in the 
sky, the path of the ships on the ocean and the course of 
the wind. Not a sparrow can fall without his knowledge. 
He is the supreme God, the God of gods, harsh to the 
guilty and gracious to the penitent. He conforms to the 
eternal law of the moral world which he has established. 
Yet in his mercy he is willing to forgive those who offend 
against him. " He is merciful even to him who has com- 
mitted sin.” 10 In almost all the hymns to Varuna we 
find prayers for the forgiveness of sin, filled with confes-

sions of guilt and repentance , 1 which show that the Aryan 
poets had a sense of the burden of sin and prayer. 

The theism of the Vaisnavas and the Bhagavatas, 
with its emphasis on bhakti, is to be traced to the Vedic 
worship of Varuna, with its consciousness of sin and trust 
in divine forgiveness. Professor Macdonell says that 
“ Varuna’s character resembles that of the divine ruler in 
a monotheistic belief of an exalted type.” 2 

The law of which Varuna is the custodian is called the 
Rta. Rta literally means “ the course of things.” It 
stands for law in general and the immanence of justice. 
This conception must have been originally suggested by 
the regularity of the movements of sun, moon and stars, 
the alternations of day and of night, and of the seasons. 

1 The following hymn to Varuna translated by Muir into verse, vol. v. 
O.S.T., p. 64, though from the Atharva-Veda (iv. 16. 1-5), brings out the 
high conception of God cherished by the Vedic Aryans : 

" The mighty Lord on high, our deeds, as if at hand espies : 

The gods know all men do, though men would fain their deeds disguise. 
Whoever stands, whoever moves, or steals from place to place, 

Or hides him in his secret cell — the gods his movements trace. 
Wherever two together plot, and deem they are alone, 

King Varuna is there, a third, and all their schemes are known. 

This earth is his, to him belong those vast and boundless skies ; 

Both seas within him rest, and yet in that small pool he lies. 

Whoever far beyond the sky should think his way to wing. 

He could not there elude the grasp of Varuna the king. 

His spies descending from the skies glide all this world around. 

Their thousand eyes all-scanning sweep to earth’s remotest bound. 
Whate’er exists in heaven and earth, whate’er beyond the skies. 

Before the eyes of Varuna, the king, unfolded lies. 

The ceaseless winkings all he counts of every mortal’s eyes : 

He wields this universal frame, as gamester throws his dice. 

Those knotted nooses which thou fling’st, O God, the bad to snare, — 
All liars let them overtake, but all the truthful spare." 

Again: “ How can I get near to Varuna ? will he accept my offering with- 
out displeasure ) When shall I, with a quiet mind see him propitiated ? 

“ I ask, O Varuna, wishing to know this my sin ; I go to ask the wise, 
the sages, all tell me the same : Varuna it is who is angry with thee.” 

" Was it for an old sin, O Varuna, that thou wishest 10 destroy thy friend 
who always praises thee ? Tell me, thou unconquerable Lord, and I will 
quickly turn to thee with praise, freed from sin.” 

“ Absolve us from the sins of our fathers, and from those which we 
committed with our own bodies." 

" It is not our own doing, Varuna, it was a slip ; an intoxicating draught, 
passion, dice, thoughtlessness.”

THE HYMNS OF THE RG-VEDA 

Rta denotes the order of the world. Everything that is 
ordered in the universe has Rta for its principle. It cor- 
responds to the universals of Plato. 1 The world of experi- 
ence is a shadow or reflection of the Rta, the permanent 
reality which remains unchanged in all the welter of muta- 
tion. The universal is prior to the particular, and so the 
Vedic seer thinks that Rta exists before the manifestation 
of all phenomena. The shifting series of the world are 
the varying expressions of the constant Rta. So Rta is 
called the father of all. “ The Maruts come from afar 
from the seat of the Rta.” 2 * * 5 Visnu is the embryo of the 
Rta.3 Heaven and earth are what they are by reason of 
the Rta. 4 The tendency towards the mystic conception of 
an unchanging reality shows its first signs here. The real 
is the unchanging law. What is, is an unstable show, an 
imperfect copy. The real is one without parts and changes, 
while the many shift and pass. Soon this cosmic order 
becomes the settled will of a supreme god, the law of 
morality and righteousness as well. Even the gods cannot 
transgress it. We see in the conception of Rta a develop- 
ment from the physical to the divine. Rta originally 
meant the “ established route of the world, of the sun, 
moon and stars, morning and evening, day and night.” 
Gradually it became the path of morality to be followed 
by man and the law of righteousness observed even by 
gods. “ The dawn follows the path of Rta, the right 
path ; as if she knew them before. She never oversteps 
the regions. The sun follows the path of Rta.” 5 The 
whole universe is founded on Rta and moves in it. 6 This 
conception of Rta reminds us of Wordsworth’s invocation 
to duty. 

Thou dost preserve the stars from wrong ; 

And the most ancient heavens, through thee, are fresh and strong. 

1 Hegel characterises the categories or universals of logic as " God 

before the creation of the world or any planet.” I owe this reference to 

Professor J. S. Mackenzie. The Chinese sage Lao Tsu recognises a cosmic 
order or the Tao, which serves as the foundation for his ethics, philosophy 
and religion.

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


What law is in the physical world, that virtue is in the 
moral world. The Greek conception of the moral life as a 
harmony or an ordered whole is suggested here. Varuna, 
who was first the keeper of the physical order, becomes 
the custodian of the moral order, Rtasya gopa and the 
punisher of sin. The prayer to the gods is in many cases 
for keeping us in the right path. “ 0 Indra, lead us on 
the path of Rta, on the right path over all evils.” 1 

So soon as the conception of Rta was recognised there 
was a change in the nature of gods. The world is no more 
a chaos representing the blind fury of chance elements, 
but is the working of a harmonious purpose. This faith 
gives us solace and security whenever unbelief tempts us 
and confidence in ourselves is shattered. Whatever might 
happen, we feel that there is a law of righteousness in the 
moral world answering to the beautiful order of nature. 
As sure as the sun rises to-morrow virtue will triumph. 
Rta can be trusted. 

Mitra is the companion of Varuna and is generally 
invoked along with him. He represents sometimes the 
sun and sometimes the light. He is also an all-seeing, 
truth-loving god. Mitra and Varuna are j oint -keepers of 
the Rta and forgivers of sin. Gradually, Mitra comes to 
be associated with the morning light and Varuna with the 
night-sky. Varuna and Mitra are called the Adityas, or 
the sons of Aditi, along with Aryaman and Bhaga. 

Surya is the sun. He has some ten hymns addressed 
to him. The worship of the sun is natural to the human 
mind. It is an essential part of the Greek religion. Plato 
idealised sun-worship in the Republic. To him the sun 
was the symbol of the Good. In Persia we have sun- 
worship. The sun, the author of all light and life in the 
world, has supernatural powers assigned to him. He is 
the life of " all that moveth and standeth.” He is all 
seeing, the spy of the world. He rouses men to perform 
their activities, dispels darkness and gives light. " Surya 
is rising, to pace both worlds, looking down on men, pro- 
tector of all that travel or stay, beholding right and 
wrong among men.” 1 Surya becomes the creator of the 
world and its governor.

THE HYMNS OF THE RG-VEDA 

Savitr, celebrated in eleven entire hymns, is also a 
solar deity. He is described as golden-eyed, golden-handed 
and golden-tongued. He is sometimes distinguished from 
the Sun, 1 though often identified with him. Savitr repre- 
sents not only the bright sun of the golden day, but also 
the invisible sun of night. He has a lofty moral side, 
being implored by the repentant sinner for the forgiveness 
of sin : “ Whatever offence we may have committed against 
the heavenly host, through feebleness of understanding, or 
through weakness or through pride or through human 
nature, O Savitr, take from us this sin.” 2 The Gayatri 
hymn is addressed to Surya in the form of Savitr : “ Let 
us meditate on that adorable splendour of Savitr ; may 
he enlighten our minds.” The oft-quoted hymn from the 
Yajur-Veda, “ 0 God Savitr, the Creator of All, remove 
the obstructions and grant the blessings,” is addressed to 
Savitr. 

Surya in the form of Visnu supports all the worlds. 3 
Visnu is the god of three strides. He covers the earth, 
heaven and the highest worlds visible to mortals. None 
can reach the limits of his greatness. “ We can from the 
earth know two of thy spaces, thou alone, O Visnu, 
knowest thine own highest abode.” 4 Visnu holds a sub- 
ordinate position in the Rg-Veda, though he has a great 
future before him. The basis of Vaisnavism is, however, 
found in the Rg-Veda, where Visnu is described as brhai- 
sanrah, great in body, or having the world for his body, 
pratyety dhavam, he who comes in response to the invitation 
of the devotees.5 He is said to have traversed thrice the 
earth spaces for the sake of man in distress. 6 

Pusan is another solar god. He is evidently a friend 
of man, being a pastoral god and the guardian of cattle. 
He is the god of wayfarers and husbandmen. 

Ruskin says : “ There is no solemnity so deep to a rightly 
thinking creature as that of the dawn.” The boundless 
dawn from which flash forth every morning light and life 
becomes the goddess Usas, the Greek Eos, the brilliant

maid of morning loved by the Asvins, and the sun, but 
vanishing before the latter as he tries to embrace her with 
his golden rays. 

The Asvins are invoked in about fifty hymns and in 
parts of many others. 1 They are inseparable twins, the 
bright lords of brilliance and lustre, strong and agile and 
fleet as eagles. They are the children of Heaven, and the 
Dawn is their sister. It is supposed that the phenomenon 
of twilight is their material basis. That is why we have 
two Asvins corresponding to the dawn and the dusk. They 
gradually become the physicians of gods and men, wonder- 
workers, protectors of conjugal love and life and the 
deliverers of the oppressed from all kinds of suffering. 

We have already mentioned Aditi from whom the several 
gods called Adityas are born. Aditi literally means “ un- 
bound or unlimited.” It seems to be a name for the 
invisible, the infinite which surrounds us on all sides, and 
also stands for the endless expanse beyond the earth, the 
clouds and the sky. It is the immense substratum of all 
that is here and also beyond. “ Aditi is the sky, Aditi is 
the intermediate region, Aditi is father and mother and 
son, Aditi is all the gods and the five tribes, Aditi is what- 
ever has been born, Aditi is whatever shall be born.” * 
Here we have the anticipation of a universal all-embracing, 
all-producing nature itself, the immense potentiality or 
the prakrti of the Samkhya philosophy. It corresponds to 
Anaximander’s Infinite. 

An important phenomenon of nature raised to a deity 
is Fire. Agni 3 is second in importance only to Indra, 
being addressed in at least 200 hymns. The idea of Agni 
arose from the scorching sun, which by its heat kindled 
inflammable stuff. It came from the clouds as lightning. 
It has also its origin in flintstone.4 It comes from fire 
sticks. 5 Matarisvan, like Prometheus, is supposed to have 
brought fire back from the sky and entrusted it to the 
keeping of the Bhrgus. 6 The physical aspects are evident 
in the descriptions of Agni as possessing a tawny beard.

sharp jaws and burning teeth. Wood or ghee is his food. 
He shines like the sun dispelling the darkness of night. 
His path is black when he invades the forests and his 
voice is like the thunder of heaven. He is dhumaketu, 
having smoke for his banner. " O Agni, accept this log 
which I offer to thee, blaze up brightly and send up thy 
sacred smoke, touch the topmost heavens with thy mane 
and mix with the beams of the sun.” 1 Fire is thus seen 
to dwell not only on earth in the hearth and the altar but 
also in the sky and the atmosphere, as the sun and the 
dawn and as lightning in the clouds. He soon becomes a 
supreme god, stretching out heaven and earth. As the 
concept grew more and more abstract it also became more 
and more sublime. He becomes the mediator between 
gods and men, the helper of all. “ O Agni, bring hither 
Varuna to our offering. Bring Indra from the skies, the 
Maruts from the air.” * “I hold Agni to be my father. I 
hold him to be my kinsman, my brother and also my 
friend.” 3 

Soma, the god of inspiration, the giver of immortal 
life, is analogous to the Haoma of the Avesta and Dionysos 
of Greece, the god of the wine and the grape. All these 
are the cults of the intoxicants. Miserable man requires 
something or other to drown his sorrows in. When he 
takes hold of an intoxicating drink for the first time, a 
thrill of delight possesses him. He is mad, no doubt, but 
he thinks it is a divine madness. What we call spiritual 
vision, sudden illumination, deeper insight, larger charity 
and wider understanding — all these are the accompani- 
ments of an inspired state of the soul. No wonder the 
drink that elevates the spirit becomes divine. Whitney 
observes : “ The simple-minded Aryan people, whose 

whole religion was a worship of the wonderful powers and 
phenomena of nature, had no sooner perceived that the 
liquid had power to elevate the spirits and produce a 
temporary frenzy under the influence of which the individual 
was prompted to and capable of deeds beyond his natural 
powers, than they found in it something divine ; it was to 
their apprehension a god, endowing those into whom it

entered with god-] ike powers ; the plant which afforded it 
became to them the king of plants, the process of preparing 
was a holy sacrifice ; the instruments used therefor were 
sacred. The high antiquity of this cultus is attested by 
the references to it found occurring in the Persian Avesta ; 
it seems, however, to have received a new impulse on 
Indian territory,” 1 Soma is not completely personalised. 
The plant and the juice are so vividly present to the poet’s 
mind that he cannot easily deify them. The hymns 
addressed to Soma were intended to be sung while the 
juice was being pressed out of the plant. “ O Soma, poured 
out for Indra to drink, flow on purely in a most sweet and 
exhilarating current.” 2 In viii. 48. 3 the worshipper 
exclaims : “ We have drunk the Soma, we have become 
immortal, we have entered into light, we have known the 
gods.” This confusion of spiritual ecstasy with physical 
intoxication is not peculiar to the Vedic age. William 
James tells us that the drunken consciousness is a bit of 
the mystic consciousness. It is believed that we can attain 
the divine through physical intoxication. Soma gradually 
acquires medicinal powers, helping the blind to see and 
the lame to walk .3 The following beautiful hymn to Soma 
points out how important a place he occupies in the 
affections of the Vedic Aryans. 

Where there is eternal light, in the world, where the sun is placed, 
in that immortal, imperishable world, place me, O Soma. 
Where the son of Vivasvat reigns as King, where the secret place 
of heaven is, where these mighty waters are, make me immortal. 
Where life is free, in the third heaven of heavens, where the worlds 
are radiant, there mr.ke me immortal. 

Where wishes and desires are, where the bowl of the bright Soma 
is, where there is food an ] rejoicing, there make me immortal. 
Where there is happiness and delight, where joy and pleasure reside, 
where the desires of our desire are attained, there make me 
immortal. < 

In the hymn to Soma just quoted there is a reference 
to the son of Vivasvat, who is the Yama of the Rg-Veda

answering to the Yima, the son of Vivanhvant of the 
Avesta. There are three hymns addressed to Yama. He 
is the chief of the dead, not so much a god as a ruler of 
the dead. He was the first of mortals to die and find his 
way to the other world, the first to tread the path of the 
fathers. 1 Later he acts as the host receiving new-comers. 
He is the king of that kingdom, for he has the longest 
experience of it. He is sometimes invoked as the god of 
the setting sun. 2 * * In the Brahmanas Yama becomes the 
judge and chastiser of men. But in the Rg-Veda he is yet 
only their king. Yama illustrates the truth of the remark 
which Lucian puts into the mouth of Heraclitus : “ What are 
men ? Mortal gods. What are gods ? Immortal men.” 

Parjanya was the Aryan sky god. He seems to have 
become Indra after the Aryans entered India, for Indra is 
unknown to the other members of the Aryan family. In 
the Vedas Parjanya is another name for the sky. "The 
Earth is the mother and I am the son of the Earth, 
Parjanya is the father. May he help us.” 3 In the Atharva- 
Veda Earth is called the wife of Parjanya.r Parjanya is 
the god of cloud and rain. 5 He rules as god over the whole 
world ; all creatures rest in him ; he is the life of all that 
moves and rests. 6 There are also passages where the word 
Parjanya is used for cloud or rain. 7 Max Muller is of 
opinion that Parjanya is identical with the Lithuanian god 
of thunder called Perkunas. 8 

Of all the phenomena of nature which arouse the feel- 
ing of awe and terror, nothing can challenge comparison 
with thunder storms. “ Yes, when I send thunder and 
lightning,” says Indra, “ then you believe in me.” Judging 
from the hymns addressed to him, Indra is the most 
popular god of the Vedas. When the Aryans entered 
India they found that, as at present, their prosperity was a 
mere gamble in rain. The rain god naturally becomes the 
national god of the Indo-Aryans. Indra is the god of 
the atmospheric phenomena, of the blue sky. He is the

earth trembles at his approach. Gradually Indra's con- 
nexion with the sky and the thunder-storms is forgotten. 
He becomes the divine spirit, the ruler of all the world 
and all the creatures, who sees and hear* everything, and 
inspires men with their best thoughts and impulses. 1 The 
god of the thunder-storm vanquishing the demons of drought, 
and darkness becomes the victorious god of battles of the 
Aryans in their struggles with the natives. The times 
were of great activity, and the people were engaged in an 
adventure of conquest and domination. He will have 
nothing to do with the native peoples of alien faiths. 
“ The hero- god who as soon as born shielded the gods, 
before whose might the two worlds shook — that, ye people, 
is Indra ; who made fast the earth and the heaving 
mountains, measured the space of air, upheld the heaven— 
that, ye people, is Indra ; who slew the serpent and freed 
the seven streams, rescued the cows, the pounder in battle 
— that, ye people, is Indra ; the dread god of whom ye 
doubting ask, where is he, and sneer, he is not, he who 
sweeps away the enemies’ possessions, have faith in him — 
that, ye people, is Indra ; in whose might stand horses, 
cattle and armed hosts, to whom both lines of battle call — 
that, ye people, is Indra ; without whose aid men never 
conquer, whose arrow little thought of slays the wicked — 
that, ye people, is Indra.” 2 This champion-god acquires 
the highest divine attributes, rules over the sky, the earth, 
the waters and the mountains, 3 and gradually displaces 
Varuna from his supreme position in the Vedic pantheon. 
Varuna, the majestic, the just and the serene, the con- 
stant in purpose, he is not fit for the struggling, conquering, 
active times on which the Aryans have entered. So we 
hear the echo of this great revolution in the Vedic world 
in some hymns.4

Indra had also to battle with other gods worshipped 
by the different tribes settled in India. There were wor 
shippers of waters, 1 the Asvattha tree. 2 Many of the 
demons with whom Indra fought were the tribal gods such 
as Vrtra, the serpent.3 Another foe of Indra, in the 
period of the Rg-Veda, was Krsna, the deified hero of a 
tribe called the Krsnas. The verse reads : " The fleet 
Krsna lived on the banks of the Amsumatl (Jumna) river 
with ten thousand troops. Indra of his own wisdom 
became cognisant of this loud-yelling chief. He destroyed 
the marauding host for our benefit.” 4 This is the inter- 
pretation suggested by Sayana, and the story has some 
interest in connection with the Krsna cult. The later 
Puranas speak of the opposition between Indra and 
Krsna. It may be that Krsna is the god of the 
pastoral tribe which was conquered by Indra in the 
Rg-Veda period, though at the time of the Bhagavadgita 
he recovered much lost ground and got reinforced by 
becoming identified with the Vasudeva of the Bhaga- 
vatas and the Visnu of the Vaisnavas. It is this 
miscellaneous origin and history that make him the 
author of the Bhagavadgita, the personation of the 


nances. I rule in men’s highest sanctuary — I am king Varuna — I, O Indra, 
am Varuna, and mine are the two wide, deep, blessed worlds. A wise maker, 
I created all the beings ; Heaven and earth are by me preserved. I made 
the flowing waters to swell. I established in their sacred seat the heavens. 
T, the holy Aditya, spread out the triparite universe " (heaven, earth and 
atmosphere). 

(Indra speaks) : " I am invoked by the steed-possessing men when 
pressed hard in battle ; I am the mighty one who stirs up the fight and whirls 
up the dust, in my overwhelming strength. All that have I done, nor can 
the might of all the gods restrain me, the unconquered ; when I am exhila- 
rated by libations and prayers, then quake both boundless worlds.” 

The Rsi speaks : “ That thou didst all these things, all beings know ; 
and now thou hast proclaimed it to Varuna, O Ruler ! Thee Indra men 
praise as the slayer of Vrtra ; it was thou who didst let loose the imprisoned 
waters " (iv. 42). 

“ I now say farewell, to the father, the Asura ; I go from him to whom 
no sacrifices are offered, to him to whom men sacrifice — in choosing Indra, I 
give up the father though I have lived with him many years in friendship. 
Agni, Varuna and Soma must give way ; the power goes to another. I 
see it come ” (x. 124).

By the side of Indra are several minor deities repre- 
senting other atmospheric phenomena, Vata or Vayu, the 
wind, the Maruts, the terrible storm-gods, and Rudra the 
howler. Of wind a poet says : “ Where was he born and 
whence did he spring, the life of the gods and the germ 
of the world ? That god moves about, where he listeth, 
his voices are heard, but he is not to be seen.” 2 Vata is 
an Indo-Iranian god. The Maruts are the deifications of 
the great storms so common in India, “ when the air is 
darkened by dust and clouds, when in a moment the trees 
are stripped of their foliage, their branches shivered, their 
stems snapped, when the earth seems to reel and the 
mountains shake and the rivers are lashed into foam and 
fury.” 3 Maruts are powerful and destructive usually, but 
sometimes they are also kind and beneficent. They lash 
the world from end to end, or clear the air and bring the 
rain. 4 They are the comrades of Indra and sons of Dyaus. 
Indra is sometimes called the eldest of the Maruts. On 
account of their fierce aspects they are considered to be 
the sons of Rudra the militant God.5 Rudra has a very 
subordinate position in the Rg-Veda, being celebrated 
only in three entire hymns. He holds a thunder-bolt in 
his arms and discharges lightning shafts from the skies. 
Later he becomes Siva the benignant, with a whole tradi- 
tion developed round him. 6 

We also come across certain goddesses similarly de- 
veloped. Usas and Aditi are goddesses. The river Sindhu 

1 Later on, the Krsna cult became superior to the lower forms of worship 
of snakes and serpents and to the Vedic worship of Indra. Sister Nivedita 
writes : “ Krsna conquers the snake Kalfya and leaves his own footprint 
on his head. Here is the same struggle that we can trace in the personality 
of Ava as Nagesvara. between the new devotional faith and the old tradi- 
tional worship of snakes and serpents. He persuades the shepherds to 
abandon the sacrifice to Indra. Here he directly overrides the older Vedic 
gods, who, as in some parts of the Himalayas to-day, seem to know nothing 
of the interposition of Brahma " ( Footfalls of Indian History, p. 212).

is celebrated as a goddess in one hymn, 1 and Sarasvati, 
first the name of a river, gradually becomes the goddess 
of learning.- Vak is the goddess of speech. AranyanI is 
the goddess of the forest. 3 The later £akta systems utilise 
the goddesses of the Rg-Veda. The Vedic Aryan prayed 
to the Sakti or the energy of God, as he meditated on the 
adorable divine light that burnt up all dross : “ Come 

thou, O goddess, that granteth our prayers, Thou art the 
unperishing, the equal of Brahman.” 4 

When thought advanced from the material to the 
spiritual, from the physical to the personal, it was easy 
to conceive of abstract deities. Most of such deities occur 
in the last book of the Rg-Veda, thus indicating then 
relatively late origin. We have Manyu,5 Sraddha, 6 etc. 
Certain qualities associated with the true conception of 
god are deified. Tvastr, sometimes identified with Savitr,7 
is “ the maker ” or the constructor of the world. He 
forged Indra’s thunder-bolt, sharpened the axe of Brahma- 
naspati, made the cups out of which the gods drink Soma, 
and gave shape to all living things. Brahmanaspati is a 
very late god, belonging to the period when sacrifices 
began to come into vogue. Originally the lord of prayer, 
he soon became the god of sacrifices. We see in him the 
transition between the spirit of the pure Vedic religion 
and the later Brahmanism. 8

Monotheistic Tendencies 

As we shall see in our discussion of the Atharva-Veda, 
mythical conceptions from beyond the limits of the Aryan 
world belonging to a different order of thought entered 
into the Vedic pantheon. All this crowding of gods and 
goddesses proved a weariness to the intellect. So a tendency

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


showed itself very early to identify one god with another 
or throw all the gods together. The attempts at classifi- 
cation reduced the gods to the three spheres of the earth, 
the air and the sky. Sometimes these gods are said to be 
333, or other combinations of three in number. 1 The gods 
are also invoked in pairs when they fulfil identical func- 
tions. They are sometimes thrown together in one large 
concept of a Visve devah, or pantheon. This tendency at 
systematisation had its natural end in monotheism, which 
is simpler and more logical than the anarchy of a crowd 
of gods and goddesses thwarting each other. 

Monotheism is inevitable with any true conception of 
God. The Supreme can only be one. We cannot have 
two supreme and unlimited beings. Everywhere the ques- 
tion was asked whether a god was himself the creation of 
another. A created god is no God at all. With the grow- 
ing insight into the workings of the world and the nature 
of godhead the many gods tended to melt into one. The 
perception of unity realised in the idea of Rta worked 
in support of monotheism. If the varied phenomena of 
nature demand many gods, should not the unity of nature 
require a single god who embraces all things that are ? 
Trust in natural law means faith in one God. The advance 
of this conception implies the paralysis of superstition. 
An orderly system of nature has no room for miraculous 
interferences in which alone superstition and confused 
thought find the signs of polytheism. In the worship of 
Varuna we have the nearest approach to monotheism. 
Attributes moral and spiritual, such as justice, beneficence, 
righteousness, and even pity were ascribed to him. There 
has been a growing emphasis on the higher and more 
idealistic side to the suppression or comparative neglect of 
the gross or material side. Varuna is the god to whom 
man and nature, this world and the other all belong. He 
cares not only for external conduct but also for inner 
purity of life. The implicit demand of the religious con- 
sciousness for one supreme God made itself manifest in 
what is characterised as the henotheism of the Vedas. It 
is, according to Max Muller, who coined the term, the 
■ See R.V.. iii. 9. 9. 



THE HYMNS OF THE RG-VEDA

worshipping of each divinity in turn, as if it were the greatest 
and even the only god. But the whole position is a logical 
contradiction, where the heart showed the right path of 
progress and belief contradicted it. We cannot have a 
plurality of gods, for religious consciousness is against it. 
Henotheism is an unconscious groping towards monotheism. 
The weak mind of man is yet seeking fcr its object. The 
Vedic Aryan felt keenly the mystery of the ultimate and 
the inadequacy of the prevailing conceptions. The gods 
worshipped as supreme stand side by side, though for the 
moment only one holds the highest position. The one 
god is not the denial of the other gods. Even minor gods 
sometimes assume the highest rank. It all depends upon 
the devotion of the poet and the special object he has in 
view. “ Varuna is the heaven, Varuna the earth, Varuna 
the air, Varuna is the universe and all besides.” Some- 
times Agni is all the gods. Sometimes Indra is greater 
than all gods. For the moment each god seems to become 
a composite photograph of all others. Self-surrender of 
man to God, the central fact of religious experience, is 
possible only with one God. Thus henotheism seems to be 
the result of the logic of religion. It is not, as Bloomfield 
suggests, “ polytheism grown cold in service, and unnice 
in its distinctions, leading to an opportunist monotheism, in 
which every god takes hold of the sceptre and none keeps it .” 1 

When each god is looked upon as the creator and 
granted the attributes of Visvakarman, maker of the world, 
Prajapati, lord of creatures, it is easy to drop the personal 
peculiarities and make a god of the common functions, 
especially when the several gods are only cloudy and con- 
fused concepts and not real persons. 

The gradual idealisation of the conception of God as 
revealed in the cult of Varuna, the logic of religion which 
tended to make the gods flow into one another, the heno- 
theism which had its face set in the direction of mono- 
theism, the conception of Rta or the unity of nature, and 
the systematising impulse of the human mind — all helped 
towards the displacement of a polytheistic anthropomor- 
phism by a spiritual monotheism. The Vedic seers at

this period were interested in discovering a single creative 
cause of the universe, itself uncreated and imperishable. 
The only logical way of establishing such a monotheism 
was by subordinating the gods under one higher being, or 
controlling spirit, which could regulate the workings of 
the lower gods. This process satisfied the craving for one 
god and yet allowed them to keep up the continuity with 
the past. Indian thought, however daring and sincere, 
was never hard and rude. It did not usually care to 
become unpopular, and so generally made compromises ; but 
pitiless logic, which is such a jealous master, had its 
vengeance, with the result that to-day Hinduism, on account 
of its accommodating spirit, has come to mean a hetero- 
geneous mass of philosophies, religions, mythologies and 
magics. The many gods were looked upon as the different 
embodiments of the universal spirit. They were ruling in 
their own respective spheres under the suzerainty of the 
supreme. Their powers were delegated and their lordship 
was only a viceroyalty, but not a sovereignty. The cap- 
ricious gods of a confused nature-worship became the cosmic 
energies whose actions were regulated in a harmonious 
system. Even Indra and Varuna become departmental 
deities. The highest position in the later part of the Rg-Veda 
is granted to Visvakarman. 1 He is the all-seeing god who 
has on every side eyes, faces, arms, feet, who produces heaven 
and earth through the exercise of his arms and wings, who 
knows all the worlds, but is beyond the comprehension of 
mortals. Brhaspati has also his claims for the supreme 
rank. 2 In many places it is Prajapati, the lord of creatures.3 
Hiranyagarbha, the golden god, occurs as the name of the 
Supreme, described as the one Lord of all that exists.4

and inquiry, comes out from the fact that we find the 
questioning mood asserting itself very often. The necessity 
to postulate a number of gods is due to the impulse of 
mind which seeks to understand things instead of accepting 
facts as they are given to it. “ Where is the sun by night ? ” 
“ Where go the stars by day ? ” “ Why does the sun 
not fall down ? ” “ Of the two, night and day, which is 
the earlier, which the later ? ” “ Whence comes the wind, 

and whither goes it ? ” 1 Such are the questions and the 
feelings of awe and wonder which constitute the birthplace 
of all science and philosophy. We have seen also the 
instinctive groping for know'ledge revealing itself in all 
forms and fancies. Many gods were asserted. The long- 
ing of the human heart could not be satisfied with a 
pluralistic pantheon. The doubt arose as to which god 
was the real one. Kasmai devaya havisa vidhema, “ to 
what god shall we offer our oblation ? ” a The humble 
origin of the gods was quite patent. The new gods grew 
on Indian soil, and some were borrowed from the native 
races. A prayer to make us faithful 3 is not possible in a 
time of unshaken faith. Scepticism was in the air. Indra’s 
existence and supremacy were questioned. 4 The nastika or 
the denying spirit was busy at work dismissing the whole 
as a tissue of falsehood. Hymns were addressed to unknown 
gods. We reach the “ twilight of the gods.” in which 
they are slowly passing away. In the Upanisads the 
twilight changed into night and the very gods disappeared 
but for the dreamers of the past. Even the single great 
Being of the monotheistic period did not escape criticism. 
The mind of man is not satisfied with an anthropomorphic 
deity. If we say there is one great god under whom the 
others are, the question is not left unasked. “ Who has 
seen the firstborn, when he that had no bones bore him 
that has bones ? Where is the life, the blood, the self of 
the universe ? Who went to ask of any who knew ? ”5 It 
is the fundamental problem of philosophy. What is the 
life or essence of the universe ? Mere dogma will not do. 
We must feel or experience the spiritual reality. The

question therefore is, “ Who has seen the firstborn ? ” 1 
The seeking minds did not so much care for personal com- 
fort and happiness as for absolute truth. Whether you 
look upon God with the savage as an angry and offended 
man or with the civilised as a merciful and compassionate 
being, the judge of all the earth, the author and controller 
of the world, it is a weak conception that cannot endure 
criticism. The anthropomorphic ideas must vanish. They 
give us substitutes for God, but not the true living God. 
We must believe in God, the centre of life, and not His 
shadow as reflected in men’s minds. God is the inex- 
haustible light surrounding us on all sides. Prano Virat 
(“Life is immense”). It includes thoughts no less than 
things. The same reveals itself under different aspects. 
It is one, uniform, eternal, necessary, infinite and all- 
powerful. From it all flows out. To it all returns. What- 
ever the emotional value of a personal God may be, truth 
sets up a different standard and requires a different object 
of worship. However cold and remote, awful and displeas- 
ing it may seem to be, it does not cease to be the truth. 
Monotheism, to which a large part of humanity even to-day 
clings, failed to satisfy the later Vedic thinkers. 

They applied to the central principle the neuter term 
Sat, to show that it is above sex. They were convinced 
that there was something real of which Agni, Indra, Varuna, 
etc., were only the forms or names. That something was, 
not many, but one, impersonal, ruling “ over all that is 
unmoving and that moves, that walks or flies, being 
differently born.”* “The real is one, the learned call it 
by various names, Agni, Yama and Matarisvan.” 3

THE HYMNS OF THE RG-VEDA 

This one is the soul of the world, the reason immanent 
in the universe, the source of all nature, the eternal energy. 
It is neither the heaven nor the earth, neither sunshine nor 
storm, but another essence, perhaps the Rta substantiated, 
the Aditi spiritualised, the one breathing breathless. 1 We 
cannot see it, we cannot adequately describe it. With a 
touching sincerity the poet concludes : “ We never will 
behold him who gave birth to these things.” “ As a fool, 
ignorant in my own mind, I ask for the hidden places of 
the gods — not having discovered I ask the sages who may 
have discovered, not knowing in order to know.” 2 It is 
the supreme reality which lives in all things and moves 
them all, the real one that blushes in the rose, breaks into 
beauty in the clouds, shows its strength in the storms and 
sets the stars in the sky. Here then we have the intuition 
of the true God, who of all the gods is the only God, 
wonderful any day, but surpassingly wonderful because 
it was at such an early hour in the morning of mind’s 
history that the true vision was seen. In the presence of 
this one reality, the distinction between the Aryan and 
the Dravidian, the Jew and the heathen, the Hindu and 
the Muslim, the pagan and the Christian, all fade away. 
We have here a momentary vision of an ideal where of all 
earthly religions are but shadows pointing to the perfect 
day. The one is called by many names. “ Priests and 
poets with words make into many the hidden reality which 
is but one.” 3 Man is bound to form very imperfect ideas 
of this vast reality. The desires of his soul seem to be 
well satisfied with inadequate ideas, ” the idols which we 
here adore.” No two idols can be exactly the same, since 
no two men have exactly the same ideas. It is stupidity 
to quarrel about the symbols by which we attempt to 
express the real. The one God is called differently accord- 
ing to the different spheres in which he works or the tastes 
of the seeking souls. This is not to be viewed as any 
narrow accommodation to popular religion. It is a revela- 
tion of a profound philosophic truth. To Israel the same

revelation came : " The Lord, thy God, is One.” Plutarch 
says : “ There is One Sun and One sky over all nations 
and one Deity under many names.”

Controllest all, hail, Zeus, for unto thee

Of this monistic theory of the Rg-Veda Deussen writes : 
“ The Hindus arrive at this monism by a method essen- 
tially different from that of other countries. Monotheism 
was attained in Egypt by a mechanical identification of 
the various local gods, in Palestine by proscription of other 
gods and violent persecution of their worshippers for the 
benefit of their national god Jehovah. In India they 
reached monism, though not monotheism on a more philo- 
sophical path, seeing through the veil of the manifold the 
unity which underlies it.” * Max Muller says : “ What- 
ever is the age when the collection of our Rg-Veda Samhita 
was finished, it was before that age that the conviction 
had been formed that there is but One, One Being, neither 
male nor female, a Being raised high above all the condi- 
tions and limitations of personality and of human nature, 
and nevertheless the Being that was really meant by all 
such names as Indra, Agni, Matarisvan, nay, even by the 
name of Prajapati, Lord of creatures. In fact, the Vedic 
poets had arrived at a conception of the godhead which 
was reached once more by some of the Christian philoso- 
phers at Alexandria, but which even at present is beyond 
the reach of many who call themselves Christians.” 3 

In some of the advanced hymns of the Rg-Veda the 
Supreme is indifferently called He or It. The apparent 
vacillation between monotheism and monism, a striking 
feature of Eastern as well of Western philosophy, revealed 
itself here for the first time in the history of thought. The 
same formless, impersonal, pure and passionless being of

philosophy is worshipped by the warm full-blooded heart 
of the emotional man as a tender and benevolent deity. 
This is inevitable. Religious consciousness generally takes 
the form of a dialogue, a communion of two wills, finite 
and infinite. There is a tendency to make of God an in- 
finite person over against the finite man. But this con- 
ception of God as one among many is not the highest truth 
of philosophy. Except for a few excessively logical people 
who wish to push their principles to their extreme conclu- 
sions, there cannot be religion without a personal God. 
Even the philosopher when asked to define the highest 
reality cannot but employ terms which reduce it to the 
lower level. Man knows that his limited powers cannot 
compass the transcendent vastness of the Universal Spirit. 
Yet he is obliged to describe the Eternal in his own small 
way. Bound down by his limitations he necessarily frames 
inadequate pictures of the vast, sublime, inscrutable source 
and energy of all things. He creates idols for his own 
satisfaction. Personality is a limitation, and yet only a 
personal God can be worshipped. Personality implies the 
distinction of self and not-self, and hence is inapplicable to 
the Being who includes and embraces all that is. The 
personal God is a symbol, though the highest symbol of 
the true living God. The formless is given a form, the 
impersonal is made personal ; the omnipresent is fixed to 
a local habitation ; the eternal is given a temporal setting. 
The moment we reduce the Absolute to an object of wor- 
ship, it becomes something less than the Absolute. To 
have a practical relationship with finite will, God must be 
less than the Absolute, but if He is less than the Absolute, 
then He cannot be the object of worship in any effective 
religion. If God is perfect, religion is impossible ; if God 
is imperfect, religion is ineffective. We cannot have with 
a finite limited God the joy of peace, the assurance of 
victory and the confidence in the ultimate destiny of the 
universe. True religion requires the Absolute. Hence to 
meet the demands of both popular religion and philosophy, 
the Absolute Spirit is indiscriminately called He or It. It 
is so in the Upanisads. It is so in the Bhagavadgita and 
the Vedanta Sutras. We need not put this down to a 



98 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

conscious compromise of theistic and monistic elements or 
any elusiveness of thought. The monistic conception is 
also capable of developing the highest religious spirit. 
Only prayer to God is replaced by contemplation of the 
Supreme Spirit that rules the world, the love that thrills 
it in an unerring but yet lavish way. The sympathy 
between the mind of the part and that of the whole is 
productive of the highest religious emotion. Such an 
ideal love of God and meditation on the plenitude of 
beauty and goodness flood the mind with the cosmic emo- 
tion. It is true that such a religion seems to the man 
who has not reached it and felt its power too cold or too 
intellectual, yet no other religion can be philosophically 
justified. 

All forms of religion which have appeared on earth 
assume the fundamental need of the human heart. Man 
longs for a power above him on which he could depend. 
One that is greater than himself whom he could worship. 
The gods of the several stages of the Vedic religion are the 
reflections of the growing wants and needs, the mental 
gropings and the heart-searchings of man. Sometimes he 
would want gods who would hear his prayers and accept 
his sacrifices, and we have gods answering to this prescrip- 
tion. We have naturalistic gods, anthropomorphic gods, but 
none of them answered to the highest conception, however 
much one might try to justify them to the mind of man 
by saying that they were the varying expressions of the 
one Supreme. The scattered rays dispersed among the 
crowd of deities are collected together in the intolerable 
splendour of the One nameless God who alone could satisfy 
the restless craving of the human heart and the sceptic 
mind. The Vedic progress did not stop until it reached 
this ultimate reality. The growth of religious thought as 
embodied in the hymns may be brought out by the men- 
tion of the typical gods : (i) Dyaus, indicative of the 

first state of nature worship ; (2) Varuna, the highly 

moral god of a later day ; (3) Indra, . the selfish god of 

the age of conquest and domination ; (4) Prajapati, the 

god of the monotheists ; and (5) Brahman, the perfection 
of all these four lower stages. This progression is as much 



THE HYMNS OF THE RG-VEDA 99 

chronological as logical. Only in the Vedic hymns we 
find them all set down side by side without any concep- 
tion of logical arrangement or chronological succession. 
Sometimes the same hymn has suggestions of them all. It 
only shows that when the text of the Rg-Veda came to 
be written all these stages of thought had already been 
passed, and people were clinging to some or all of them 
without any consciousness of their contradiction. 


VIII 

Cosmology 

The Vedic thinkers were not unmindful of the philoso- 
phical problems of the origin and nature of the world. In 
their search for the first ground of all changing things, they, 
like the ancient Greeks, looked upon water, air, etc., as 
the ultimate elements out of which the variety of the world 
is composed. Water is said to develop into the world 
through the force of time, samvatsara or year, desire or 
kama, intelligence or purusa, warmth or tapas. 1 Some- 
times water itself is derived from night or chaos, tamas, or 
air. 2 In x. 72 the world ground is said to be the asat, or 
the non-existent, with which is identified Aditi, the infinite. 
All that exists is diti, or bounded, while the a-diti, the infinite, 
is non-existent. From the infinite, cosmic force arises, 
though the latter is sometimes said to be the source of 
the infinite itself.3 These theories, however, soon related 
themselves to the non-physical, and physics by alliance 
with religion became metaphysics. 

In the pluralistic stage the several gods, Varuna, Indra, 
Agni, Visvakarman, were looked upon as the authors of 
the universe. * The method of creation is differently con- 
ceived. Some gods are supposed to build the world as 
the carpenter builds a house. The question is raised as to 
how the tree or the wood out of which the work was built 
was obtained . 5 At a later stage the answer is given that

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


Brahman is the tree and the wood out of which heaven 
and earth are made . 1 The conception of organic growth or 
development is also now and then suggested . 2 Sometimes 
the gods are said to create the world by the power of 
sacrifice. This perhaps belongs to a later stage of Vedic 
thought. 

When we get to the monotheistic level the question 
arises as to whether God created the world out of His own 
nature without any pre-existent matter or through His 
power acting on eternally pre-existent matter. The former 
view takes us to the higher monistic conception, while the 
latter remains at the lower monotheistic level, and we 
have both views in the Vedic hymns. In x. 121 we have 
an account of the creation of the world by an Omnipotent 
God out of pre-existent matter. Hiranyagarbha arose in 
the beginning from the great water which pervaded the 
universe. He evolved the beautiful world from the shape- 
less chaos which was all that existed .3 But how did it 
happen, it is asked, that the chaos produced Hiranyagarbha ? 
What is that unknown force or law of development which 
led to his rise ? Who is the author of the primeval waters ? 
According to Manu, Harivamsa and the Puranas, God was 
the author of chaos. He created it by His Will, and 
deposited a seed in it which became the golden germ in 
which He Himself was born as the Brahma or the Creator 
God. " I am Hiranyagarbha, the Supreme Spirit Himself 
become manifested in the form of Hiranyagarbha .”4 Thus 
the two eternally co-existent substances seem to be the 
evolution of the one ultimate substratum. 

This is exactly the theory of a later hymn called the 
Nasadlya hymn, which is translated by Max Muller. 

There was then neither what is nor what is not, there was no sky, 
nor the heaven which is beyond. What covered ? Where 
was it, and in whose shelter ? Was the water the deep abyss 
(in which it lay) ? 

There was no death, hence was there nothing immortal. There was 
no light (distinction) between night and day. That One 
breathed by itself without breath, other than it there has been 
nothing.

Darkness there was, in the beginning all this was a sea without light ; 
the germ that lay covered by the husk, that One was born 
by the power of heat (tapas). 

Love overcame it in the beginning, which was the seed springing 
from mind, poets having searched in their heart found by 
wisdom the bond of what is in what is not. 

Their ray which was stretched across, was it below or was it above ? 
There were seed-bearers, there were powers, self-power below, 
and will above. 

Who then knows, who has declared it here, from whence was born 
this creation ? The gods came later than this creation, who 
then knows whence it arose ? 

He from whom this creation arose, whether he made it or did not 
make it, the highest seer in the highest heaven, he forsooth 
knows, or does even he not know ? 1 

We find in this hymn a representation of the most 
advanced theory of creation. First of all there was no 
existent or non-existent. The existent in its manifested 
aspect was not then. We cannot on that account call it 
the non-existent, for it is positive being from which the 
whole existence arrives. The first line brings out the 
inadequacy of our categories. The absolute reality which 
is at the back of the whole world cannot be characterised 
by us as either existent or non-existent. The one breathed 
breathless by its own power . 2 Other than that there was 
not anything beyond. First cause of all it is older than 
the whole world, with the sun, moon, sky and stars. It is 
beyond time, beyond space, beyond age, beyond death and 
beyond immortality. We cannot express what it is except 
that it is. Such is the primal unconditioned groundwork 
of all being. Within that Absolute Consciousness there is 
first the fact of affirmation or positing of the primal “ I.” 
This corresponds to the logical law of identity, A is A, the 
validity of which presupposes the original self-positing. 
Immediately there must be also a non-ego as the correlate 
of the ego. The I confronts the not-I, which answers to 
“ A is not B.” The “ I ” will be a bare affirmation, a mere 
abstraction, unless there is another of which it is conscious. 
If there is no other, there is no ego. The ego implies non- 
ego as its condition. This opposition of ego and non-ego

is the primary antithesis, and the development of this impli- 
cation from the Absolute is said to be by tapas. Tapas is 
just the *' rushing forth,” the spontaneous " out-growth,” 
the projection of being into existence, the energising im- 
pulse, the innate spiritual fervour of the Absolute. Through 
this tapas we get being and non-being, the I and the 
not-I, the active Purusa and the passive prakrti, the forma- 
tive principle and the chaotic matter. The rest of the 
evolution follows from the interaction of these two opposed 
principles. According to the hymn, desire constitutes the 
secret of the being of the world. Desire or kama is the 
sign of self-consciousness, the germ of the mind, manaso 
retah. It is the ground of all advance, the spur of pro- 
gress. The self-conscious ego has desires developed in it 
by the presence of the non-ego. Desire 1 is more than 
thought. It denotes intellectual stir, the sense of deficiency 
as well as active effort. It is the bond binding the existent 
to the non-existent. The unborn, the one, the eternal breaks 
forth into a self-conscious Brahma with matter, darkness, 
non-being, zero, chaos opposed to it. Desire is the essential 
feature of this self-conscious Purusa. The last phrase, 
“ ko veda ? ” (“ who knows ? ”) brings out the mystery of 
creation which has led later thinkers to call it maya. 

There are hymns which stop with the two principles of 
Purusa and prakrti. In x. 82. 5-6, of the hymn to 
Visvakarman, we find it said that the waters of the sea 
contained the first or primordial germ. This first germ is 
the world egg floating on the primeval waters of chaos, 
the principle of the universe of life. From it arises 
Visvakarman, the firstborn of the universe, the creator 
and maker of the world. The waters are the chaos of the 
Greeks, the " without-form and void ” of Genesis, with the 
infinite will reposing on it. z Desire, will, self-conscious- 

1 Greek mythology, it is interesting to notice, connects Eros, the god of 
love, corresponding to Kama, with the creation of the universe. Plato 
says in his Symposium : " Eros neither had any parents nor is be said by any 
unlearned men or by any poet to have had any . . .” According to Aristotle, 
God moves as the object of desire. 

1 Cf. it with the account of the Genesis : " And darkness was on the 
face of the deep and the spirit of God was moving on the face of the waters " 
(Gen. i. 2) ; see also R.V., x. ’21 ; v. 72. 



THE HYMNS OF THE RG-VEDA 103 


ness, mind, vak, or the word, all these are the qualities of 
the infinite intelligence, the personal God brooding over 
the waters, the Narayana resting on the eternal Ananta. 
It is the god of Genesis who says, “ Let there be, and there 
was.” " He thought, I will create the worlds, then He 
created these various worlds, water, light, etc.” The 
Nasadiya hymn, however, overcomes the dualistic meta- 
physics in a higher monism. It makes nature and spirit 
both aspects of the one Absolute. The Absolute itself is 
neither the self nor the other, is neither self-consciousness 
of the type of I, nor unconsciousness of the type of not-I. 
It is a higher than both these. It is a transcending con- 
sciousness. The opposition is developed within itself. 
According to this account the steps of creation, when 
translated into modern terms, are: (i) the Highest Absolute; 
(2) the bare self-consciousness, I am I ; (3) the limit of self- 
consciousness in the form of another. This does not mean 
that there is a particular point at which the Absolute moves 
out. The stages are only logically but not chronologically 
successive. The ego implies the non-ego, and therefore 
cannot precede it. Nor can the non-ego precede the ego. 
Nor can the Absolute be ever without doing tapas. The 
timeless whole is ever breaking out in a series of becomings, 
and the process will go on till the self reaffirms itself 
absolutely in the varied content of experience which is 
never going to be. So the world is always restless. The 
hymn tells us the how of creation, not the whence. It is 
an explanation of the fact of creation. 1 

We see clearly that there is no basis for any conception 
of the unreality of the world in the hymns of the Rg- 
Veda. The world is not a purposeless phantasm, but is 
just the evolution of God. Wherever the word may a 
occurs, it is used only to signify the might or the power : 
“ Indra takes many shapes quickly by his maya.” 2 Yet 
sometimes maya and its derivatives, mayin, mayavant, 

1 Cf. with this the conception of a Demiurge, as used by Plato in the 
Timezus. The conception of creative imagination, set forth by E. Douglas 
Fawcett in his two books. The World as Imagination and Divine Imagining, 
may also be compared.

are employed to signify the will of the demons, 1 and we 
also find the word used in the sense of illusion or show. 2 The 
main tendency of the Rg-Veda is a naive realism. Later 
Indian thinkers distinguish five elements, ether or akasa, 
air, fire, water and earth. But the Rg-Veda postulates only 
one, water. It is the primeval matter from which others 
slowly develop. 

It is obviously wrong to think that according to the 
hymn w r e discussed there was originally non-being from 
out of which being grew. The first condition is not absolute 
non-existence, for the hymn admits the reality of the one 
breathing breathless by itself. It is their way of describing 
the absolute reality, the logical ground of the whole uni- 
verse. Being and non-being, which are correlative terms, 
cannot be applied to the One which is beyond all opposi- 
tion. Non-being only means whatever now visibly exists 
had then no distinct existence. In x. 72. 1, it is said, “ the 
existent sprang from the non-existent." Even here it does 
not mean being comes from non-being but only that dis- 
tinct being comes from non-distinct being. So we do not 
agree with the view that the hymn is “ the starting-point of 
the natural philosophy which developed into the Saihkhya 
system.” 3 

The creation of the world is sometimes traced to an 
original material as it were ; in the Purusa Sukta •» we 
find that the gods are the agents of creation, while the 
material out of which the world is made is the body of the 
great Purusa. The act of creation is treated as a sacri- 
fice in which Purusa is the victim. “ Purusa is all this 
world, what has been and shall be.” 5 Anthropomorphism 
when once it is afoot cannot be kept within bounds, and 
the imagination of the Indian brings out the greatness of 
his God by giving him huge dimensions. The poetic

3 See Macdonell, Vedic Reader, p. 207. There are Yedic thinkers who 
postulate being or non-being as the first principle (x. 129. 1 ; x. 72. 2) so 
far as the world of experience is concerned, and these perhaps gave rise to 
the later logical theories of satkaryavada, the existence of the effect in the 
cause, and asatkaryavada, the non-existence of the effect in the cause.

mind conjures up a vast composition pointing out the one- 
ness of the whole, world and God. This hymn is not, 
however, inconsistent with the theory of creation from the 
One Absolute described above. The whole world even 
according to it is due to the self-diremption of the Absolute 
into subject and object, Purusa and Prakrti. Only the 
idea is rather crudely allegorised. The supreme reality 
becomes the active Purusa, for it is said : “ From the 
Purusa Virat was born, and from Virat again Purusa.” 
Purusa is thus the begetter as well as the begotten. He 
is the Absolute as well as the self-conscious I. 


IX 


Religion 

We have seen how physical phenomena first came to 
attract attention and were assigned personalities. The 
deification of natural phenomena has a mischievous influ- 
ence on religious thought and practice. The world becomes 
peopled with gods possessed of the human sense of justice 
and capable of being influenced by the human qualities of 
hate and love. Many of the gods are not even sufficiently 
humanised and easily lapse into their past naturalistic condi- 
tion. Indra, for example, born of waters and cloud, some- 
times crashes down from heaven in thunder. Vedic gods, 
as Bloomfield says, represent “ arrested personification.” 
But even the humanised gods are only crudely personal. 
They have hands and feet like men. They are given the 
actual bodily shape, the warring passions of the human 
breast, the outer polish of a fair skin, and the dignity of a 
long beard. They fight and feast, drink and dance, eat 
and rejoice. Some of them are described to be priests in 
function such as Agni and Brhaspati ; others are warriors, 
like Indra and the Maruts. Their food is just the favourite 
food of man, milk and butter, ghee and grain , their 
favourite drink is the Soma juice. They have their share 
of human weakness and are easily pleased by flattery. 
Sometimes they are so stupidly self-centred that they 
begin to discuss what they should give. “ This is what I 



106 


INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


will do — not that, I will give him a cow or shall it be a 
horse ? I wonder if I have really had Soma from him.” 1 
In their eyes a rich offering is much more efficacious than 
a sincere prayer. It is a very simple law of give and take 
that binds gods and men, though the perfect reciprocity 
governing their relations in the later Brahmanas is yet 
remote. 

“ To make the elements of a nature religion human is 
inevitably to make them vicious. There is no great moral 
harm in worshipping a thunderstorm even though the 
lightning strikes the good and the evil quite recklessly. 
There is no need to pretend that the lightning is exercising 
a wise and righteous choice, but when once you worship 
an imaginary quasi-human being who throws the lightning 
you are in a dilemma. Either you have to admit that 
you are worshipping and flattering a being with no moral 
sense, because he happens to be dangerous, or else you 
have to invent reasons for his wrath against the people 
who happen to be struck. And they are pretty sure to 
be bad reasons. The God if personal becomes capricious 
and cruel.” 2 3 True to this view, the Vedic worship of the 
natural powers is not quite sincere, but utilitarian. We 
fear the gods whose effects arc dangerous to us, and love 
those that help us in our daily pursuits. We pray to 
Indra to send down rain, and yet beg him not to send the 
storm. The sun is implored to impart a gentle warmth, and 
not force the world into drought and famine by scorching 
heat. The gods become the sources of material prosperity, 
and prayers for the goods of the world are very common. 
And since there is a division of functions and attributes, 
we pray to particular deities for specific things. 3 The 
invocations to the gods are monotonously simple. 4 The gods 
were conceived as strong rather than good, powerful rather 
than moral. Such a religion is not capable of satisfying 
men’s ethical aspirations. It shows the strong moral sense 
of the Vedic Aryan, that in spite of the prevalent tendency

of utilitarian worship he yet regards the gods as being in 
general moral as inclined to help the good and punish the 
wicked. The highest religious aspiration of man to unite 
himself with the Supreme is recognised. 1 The many gods 
are helpful only as enabling their devotees to reach the 
Supreme. 1 * * * 

It was inevitable that sacrifices should come. For the 
depth of one’s affection for God consists in the surrender 
of one’s property and possessions to Him. We pray and 
offer. Even when sacrificial offerings came into fashion, 
the spirit was considered more important and the real 
nature of the sacrifice was insisted on. “ Utter a powerful 
speech to Indra which is sweeter than butter or honey.” 3 
Sraddha or faith in all ceremonies is necessary. 4 Varuna is 
a god who looks into the secret recesses of the human heart 
to find out the deep-lying motive. Gradually having con- 
ceived the gods as human, much too human, they thought 
that a full meal was the best way to the heart of God.5 

The question of human sacrifice is much debated. The 
case of Sunassepa 6 * does not indicate that human sacrifices 
are either allowed or encouraged in the Vedas. We hear 
of horse sacrifices.7 But against all such there were pro- 
tests heard even then. Sama Veda says : “ O, Ye Gods ! 
We use no sacrificial stake. We slay no victim. We 
worship entirely by the repetition of the sacred verses.” 8 
This cry of revolt is taken up by the Upanisads and 
carried on by the Buddhist and the Jaina schools. 

Sacrifices represent the second stage of the Vedic religion. 
In the first it was simple prayer. According to Parasa- 
rasmrti we have " meditation in the Krtayuga, sacrifices 
in the Treta, worship in the Dvapara, praises and prayers

5 “ Ritual in Homer is simple and uniform. It consists of prayer accom- 

panied by the sprinkling of the grain, followed by animal burnt offering. 

Part of the flesh is tasted by the worshippers and then made over by burning 

to the gods. The rest is eaten as a banquet with abundance of wine ” 

(Harrison: Stages of Grecian Life, pp. 87-8S). Agni is pre-eminently the 
god of sacrifices in India. It is so even in ancient Greece. Fire carries 
the offerings from earth to heavenly gods. In all these things t hero is 
nothing specially Indian.

in Kali.” This view accords well with what the Visnu- 
purana says that the rules of sacrifices were formulated in 
the tretayuga. 1 We may not agree with the division into 
yugas, but the logic of the growth of religious practice from 
meditation to sacrifice, from sacrifice to worship, from 
worship to praise and prayer, seems to be founded on fact. 

The Vedic religion does not seem to be an idolatrous 
one. There were then no temples for gods. Men had 
direct communion with gods without any mediation. Gods 
were looked upon as friends of their worshippers. “ Father 
Heaven,” “ Mother Earth,” Brother Agni ” — these are no 
idle phrases. There was a very intimate personal relation- 
ship between men and gods. Religion seems to have domi- 
nated the whole life. The dependence on God was com- 
plete. The people prayed for even the ordinary necessities 
of life. “ Give us this day our daily bread ” was true to 
the spirit of the Vedic Aryan. It is the sign of a truly 
devout nature to depend on God for even the creature 
comforts of existence. As we have already said, we have 
the essentials of the highest theism in the worship of Varuna. 
If bhakti means faith in a personal God, love for Him, dedi- 
cation of everything to His service and the attainment of 
moksa or freedom by personal devotion, surely we have all 
these elements in Varuna worship. 

In x. 15 and x. 54 we have two hymns addressed to 
the pitaras or fathers, the blessed dead w'ho dwell in heaven. 
In the Vedic hymns they are invoked together with the 
devas. 2 They are supposed to come in the form of invis- 
ible spirits to receive the prayers and offerings at sacrifices. 
The social tradition is revered perhaps in the worship of 
the fathers. There are, however, some students of the Vedas 
who believe that the hymns of the Rg-Veda do not know 
of any obsequial offerings to ancestral manes . 3 

A criticism that is generally urged against the Vedic 
religion is that the consciousness of sin is absent in the 
Veda. This is an erroneous view. Sin, in the Vedas, is 
alienation from God. 4 The Vedic conception of sin is analo- 
gous to the Hebrew’ theory. The will of God is the standard

of morality. Human guilt is short-coming. We sin when 
we transgress the commands of God. The gods are the 
upholders of the Rta, the moral order of the world. They 
protect the good and punish the wicked. Sin is not merely 
the omission of the external duties. There are moral sins 
as well as ritual sins. 1 It is a consciousness of sin that calls 
for propitiatory sacrifices. Especially in the conception of 
Varuna we have the sense of sin and forgiveness which 
reminds us of modern Christian doctrines. 

While as a rule the gods of the Rg-Veda are regarded 
as the guardians of morality, some of them still retain 
their egoistic passions, being only magnified men, nor are 
there poets wanting who are able to see the hollowness 
of all this. One hymn 1 points out how all gods and 
men are dominated by self-interest. The decay of the 
old Vedic worship is traceable to this low conception of 
many gods. Otherwise we cannot understand the beautiful 
hymn, 3 which recommends the duty of benevolence with- 
out any reference to gods. The gods seem to have become 
too weak to support a pure morality. The idea of an 
ethics independent of religion popularised in Buddhism is 
suggested here. 


X 

Ethics 

Turning to the ethics of the Rg-Veda, we find that the 
conception of Rta is of great significance. It is the antici- 
pation of the law of karma, one of the distinguishing 
characteristics of Indian thought. It is the law which 
pervades the whole world, which all gods and men must 
obey. If there is law in the world, it must work itself out. 
If by any chance its effects are not revealed here on earth, 
they must be brought to fruition elsewhere. Where law is, 
disorder and injustice are only provisional and partial. 
The triumph of the wicked is not absolute. The shipwreck 
of the good need not cause despair. 

Rta furnishes us with a standard of morality. It 
is the universal essence of things. It is the satya or

the truth of things. Disorder or An-Rta is falsehood, the 
opposite of truth. 1 The good are those who follow the 
path of Rta, the true and the ordered. Ordered conduct 
is called a true vrata. Vratani are the ways of life of 
good men who follow the path of Rta. 2 Consistency is 
the central feature of a good life. The good man of the 
Vedas does not alter his ways. Varuna, the perfect example 
of the follower of Rta, is a dhrtavrata, of unalterable ways. 
When ritual grew in importance, Rta became a synonym for 
yajna or sacrificial ceremony. 

After giving us a general account of the ideal life, the 
hymns detail the specific contents of the moral life. Prayers 
are to be offered to the gods. Rites are to be performed.3 
The Vedas assume a very close and intimate relationship 
between men and gods. The life of man has to be led 
under the very eye of God. Apart from the duties owed 
to gods there are also duties to man. 4 Kindness to all is 
enjoined ; hospitality is reckoned a great virtue. “ The 
riches of one who gives do not diminish. ... He who 
possessed of food hardens his heart against the feeble man 
craving nourishment, against the sufferer coming to him 
(for help) and pursues (his own enjoyment even) before him, 
that man finds no consoler.” 5 Sorcery, witchcraft, seduc- 
tion and adultery are condemned as vicious. 6 Gambling 
is denounced. Virtue is conformity to the law of God, 
which includes the love of man. Vice is disobedience to 
this law. ‘‘If we have sinned against the man who loves 
us, have ever wronged friend or comrade, have ever done 
an injury to a neighbour who ever dwelt with us or even 
to a stranger, O Lord ! free us from the guilt of this tres- 
pass.” 7 Some of the gods cannot be persuaded or diverted 
from the paths of righteousness by any amount of offerings. 
“ In them is to be discerned neither right nor left, neither 
before nor behind. They neither wink nor sleep, they 
penetrate all things ; they see through both evil and good ;

everything, even the most distant, is near to them ; they 
abhor and punish death ; sustain and support all that lives.” 
There are also indications of an ascetic tendency. Indra 
is said to have conquered heaven by asceticism. 1 But the 
dominant note is not one of asceticism. In the hymns we 
find a keen delight in the beauties of nature, its greatness, 
its splendour and its pathos. The motive of the sacrifices 
is love of the good things of the world. We have yet the 
deep joy in life and the world untainted by any melancholy 
gloom. Ascetic practices were, however, known. Fasting 
and abstinence were regarded as means of attaining various 
supernatural powers. In ecstatic moods it is said that the 
gods have entered into men. 2 The earliest reference to 
the ecstatic condition of ascetic sages is in Rg-Veda, x. 136.3 
The Purusa Sukta has the first reference to the 
division of Hindu society into the four classes. To under- 
stand the natural way in which this institution arose, we 
must remember that the Aryan conquerors were divided by 
differences of blood and racial ancestry from the conquered 
tribes of India. The original Aryans all belonged to one 
class, every one being priest and soldier, trader and tiller 
of the soil. There was no privileged order of priests. The 
complexity of life led to a division of classes among the 
Aryans. Though to start with each man could offer sacri- 
fices to gods without anybody's mediation, priesthood and 
aristocracy separated themselves from the proletariat. 
Originally the term Vaisya referred to the whole people. 
As we shall see, when sacrifices assume an important 
role, when the increasing complexity of life rendered 
necessary division of life, certain families, distinguished for 
learning, wisdom, poetic and speculative gifts, became 
representatives in worship under the title of Purohita, or 
one set in front. When the Vedic religion developed into 
a regulated ceremonialism, these families formed themselves 
into a class. In view of their great function of conserving 
the tradition of the Aryans, this class was freed from the 
necessity of the struggle for existence. For those engaged 
in the feverish ardour of life cannot afford the freedom

and the leisure necessary for thought and reflection. Thus 
one class concerned with the things of spirit came into 
existence. The Brahmins are not a priesthood pledged to 
support fixed doctrines, but an intellectual aristocracy 
charged with the moulding of the higher life of the 
people. The kings who became the patrons of the 
learned Brahmins were the Ksatriyas or the princes who 
had borne rule in those days. The word Ksatriya comes 
from Ksatra, “rule, dominion.” It has the same meaning 
in the Veda, the Avesta and the Persian inscriptions. The 
rest were classed as the people or the Vaisyas. Originally 
occupational, the division soon became hereditary. In the 
period of the hymns, professions were not restricted to 
particular castes. Referring to the diversity of men’s 
tastes, one verse says : “ I am a poet, my father is a doctor, 
my mother a grinder of com.” 1 There are also passages 
indicative of the rising power of the Brahmin. “ In his 
own house he dwells in peace and comfort, to him for ever 
holy food flows richly, to him the people with free will 
pay homage — the king with whom the Brahmin has prece- 
dence.” 2 Those who followed the learned professions, 
those who fought, those who traded all belonged to one 
whole, which was divided by a wider gulf from the con- 
quered races, who were grouped into two broad divisions of 
(a) the Dravidians, forming the fourth estate, and ( b ) the 
aboriginal tribes. The division into Aryans and Dasyus is 
a racial one, being based on blood and descent. It is some- 
times said that the aborigines converted and accepted by 
the Aryans are the Sudras, while those excluded by them 
are the Panchamas.3 It is maintained by others that the 
Aryans had in their own communities Sudras even before 
they came to the southern part of India. It is not easy 
to decide between these rival hypotheses. 

The system of caste is in reality neither Aryan nor 
Dravidian, but was introduced to meet the needs of the time 
when the different racial types had to live together in amity. 
It was then the salvation of the country, whatever its 
present tendency may be. The only way of conserving the

culture of a race which ran the great risk of being 
absorbed by the superstitions of the large numbers of 
native inhabitants, was to pin down rigidly by iron bonds 
the existing differences of culture and race. Unfortunately 
this device to prevent the social organisation from decay 
and death ultimately prevented it even from growing . 1 
The barriers did not show any signs of weakening when the 
tide of progress demanded it. While they contributed to 
the preservation of the social order they did not help the 
advancement of the nation as a whole. But this gives us no 
right to condemn the institution of caste as it was originally 
introduced. Only caste made it possible for a number 
of races to live together side by side without fighting each 
other. India solved peaceably the inter-racial problem 
which other people did by a decree of death. When European 
races conquered others, they took care to efface their human 
dignity and annihilate their self-respect. Caste enabled the 
Vedic Indian to preserve the integrity and independence of 
the conquering as well as the conquered races and promote 
mutual confidence and harmony. 


XI 

Eschatology 

The Vedic Aryans entered India in the pride of strength 
and joy of conquest. They loved life in its fullness. They 
therefore showed no great interest in the future of the soul. 
Life to them was bright and joyous, free from all the vexa- 
tions of a fretful spirit. They were not enamoured of 
death. They wished for themselves and their posterity a 
life of a hundred autumns . 2 They had no special doctrines 
about life after death, though some vague conceptions 

■ Referring to the hardening of classes into castes, Rhys Davids writes : 
“ It is most probable that this momentous step followed upon and was 
chiefly due to the previous establishment of a similar hard and fast line 
preventing any one belonging to the non-Aryan tribes from inter-marrying 
with an Aryan family or being incorporated into the Aryan race. It was 
the hereditary disability the Aryans had succeeded m imposing upon races 
they despised, which, reacting within their own circle and strengthened by 
the very intolerance that gave it birth, has borne such bitter fruit through 
so many centuries ” ( Hibbert Lectures, p. 23). * R.V., x. 18. 



114 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

about heaven and hell could not be avoided by reflec- 
tive minds. Rebirth is still at a distance. The Vedic 
Aryans were convinced that death was not the end of 
things. After night, the day ; after death, life. Beings 
who once had been, could never cease to be. They must 
exist somewhere, perhaps in the realm of the setting sun 
where Yama rules. The imagination of man with his 
shuddering fear of death had not yet made Yama into a 
terrible lord of vengeance. Yama and Yami are the first 
mortals who entered the other world to lord over it. 
When a man dies he is supposed to reach Yama’s king- 
dom. Yama had found for us a place, a home which is 
not to be taken from us. When the body is thrown off, 
the soul becomes endowed with a shining spiritual form 
and goes to the abode of gods where Yama and the fathers 
live immortal. The dead are supposed to get to this 
paradise by passing over water and a bridge. 1 A refer- 
ence to the paths of the fathers and the gods is found in 
x. 88. 15. This might be, as has been suggested, due to 
the distinction of the ways in which the smoke ascends in 
cremation and sacrifice. The distinction is yet in an 
undeveloped form. 

The departed souls dwell in heaven revelling with 
Yama. They there live an existence like ours. The joys 
of heaven are those of earth perfected and heightened. 
“ These bright things are the portion of those who bestow 
largesses ; there are suns for them in heaven ; they attain 
immortality; they prolong their lives.” 3 Stress is sometimes 
laid on the sensuous character in the Vedic picture of future 
life. But as Deussen observes : “ Even Jesus represents 
the kingdom of heaven as a festal gathering where they 
sit down to table 3 and drink wine/ and even a Dante 
or a Milton could not choose but borrow all the colours 
for their pictures from this world of earth.” 5 The gods 
are supposed to become immortal through the power of 
the Soma. To become like gods is the goal of our 
endeavour. For the gods live in a spiritual paradise enjoy-

ing a kind of unalloyed bliss. They neither hunger nor 
thirst, neither marry nor are given in marriage. In their 
ideal descriptions of the other world, the contrast between 
the life on earth and the life hereafter arises. The blessed 
gods live for ever. We are children of a day. The gods 
have happiness in heaven above where Yama rules ; we 
have misery for our lot on earth. What should we do to 
gain immortality ? We have to offer sacrifices to gods, 
since immortality is a free gift from heaven to the god- 
fearing. The good man who worships the gods becomes 
immortal. “ Sage Agni ! The mortal who propitiates thee 
becomes a moon in heaven.” 1 Already the difficulty is felt. 
Does he become the moon or does he become like the moon ? 
Sayana explains it as : “ He becomes like the moon, the 
rejoicer of all ” ; 2 others contend that he becomes the moon. 3 
There are indications that the Vedic Aryan believed in the 
possibility of meeting his ancestors after his death. 4 

The question arises what happens to us if we do not 
worship the gods. Is there a hell corresponding to a heaven, 
a separate place for the morally guilty, the heretics, who 
do not believe in gods ? If the heaven is only for the 
pious and the good, then the evil-minded cannot be extin- 
guished at death nor can they reach heaven. So a hell is 
necessary. We hear of Varuna thrusting the evil-doer 
down into the dark abyss from which he never returns. 
Indra is prayed to consign to the lower darkness the man 
who injures his worshipper.5 It seems to be the destiny 
of the wicked to fall into this dark depth and disappear. 
We do not as yet get the grotesque mythology of hell and 
its horrors of the later puranas. Heaven for the righteous 
and hell for the wicked is the rule. Reward follows 
righteousness, and punishment misconduct. I do not think 
that the joyless regions veiled in blind darkness into which 
the ignorant pass after death are only the world in which 
we live, though that is Deussen’s view. We have no ink- 
lings as yet of samsara or even gradations of happiness. 
There is a passage in the Rg-Veda 6 which reads : " After

116 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

he has completed what he has to do and has become old 
he departs hence ; departing hence he is once more born ; 
this is the third birth.” This has reference to the Vedic 
theory that every man has three births : the first as a 

child, the second by spiritual education, and the third after 
death. We meet with the belief in the soul as a moving 
life principle. 1 In x. 58, the soul of an apparently unconscious 
man is invited to come back to him from the trees, the sky 
and the sun. Evidently it was thought that the soul could 
be separated from the body in certain abnormal conditions. 
All this, however, does not imply that the Vedic Aryans 
were familiar with the conception of rebirth. 

XII 

Conclusion 

The hymns form the foundation of subsequent Indian 
thought. While the Brahmanas emphasise the sacrificial 
ritual shadowed forth in the hymns, the Upanisads carry 
out their philosophical suggestions. The theism of the 
Bhagavadgita is only an idealisation of Varuna-worship. 
The great doctrine of karma is yet in its infancy as Rta. 
The dualistic metaphysics of the Samkhya is the logical 
development of the conception of Hiranyagarbha floating 
on the waters. The descriptions of the ecstatic conditions 
caused by the performance of sacrifice or the singing of 
hymns or the effects of the Soma juice when we see 
the glories of the heavenly world remind us of the yogic 
states of divine blessedness where voices are heard and 
visions seen.

“ The hymns of the Rg-Veda inextricably confused ; the 
deities of an earlier era confounded ; and again merged 
together in a pantheon now complete ; the introduction 
of strange gods ; recognition of a hell of torture ; instead 
of many divinities, the one that represents all the gods 
and nature as well ; incantations for evil purposes and 
charms for a worthy purpose ; formulae of malediction to 
be directed against those ‘ whom I hate and who hate me ’ ; 
magical verses to obtain children, to prolong life, to dispel 
evil magic, to guard against poison and other ills ; the 
paralysing extreme of ritualistic reverence indicated by 
the exaltation to godhead of the ‘ remnant ’ of sacrifice ; 
hymns to snakes, to diseases, to sleep, time, and the stars ; 
curses on the ‘ priest plaguer ’ — such in general outline 
is the impression produced by a perusal of the Atharvan 
after that of the Rg-Veda.” 1 In the Rg-Veda we come 
across strange utterances of incantations and spells, charms 
and witchcrafts, hymns to inanimate things, devils and 
demons, etc. We have the charms of the robbers to lull the 
dwellers in a house to sleep, 2 spells to prevent evil spirits

causing women to miscarry , 1 and charms to expel diseases . 3 
Though sorcery and magic prevailed in the times of the 
Rg-Veda, the Vedic seers did not encourage or recognise 
them. The stray references have the appearance of an 
external addition, while in the Atharva-Veda they are the 
main theme. 

The weird religion that the Atharva-Veda represents 
is doubtless older than that of the Rg-Veda, though the 
Atharva-Veda collection is a later one. The Vedic Aryans 
as they advanced into India came across uncivilised tribes, 
wild and barbarous, and worshipping snakes and serpents, 
stocks and stones. No society can hope to continue in a 
state of progressive civilisation in the midst of uncivilised 
and half-civilised tribes, if it does not meet and overcome the 
new situation by either completely conquering them or impart- 
ing to them elements of its own culture. The alternatives 
before us are either to destroy the barbarian neighbours 
or absorb them, thus raising them to a higher level, or allow 
ourselves to be overwhelmed and swamped by them. The 
first course was impossible on account of the paucity of 
numbers. The pride of race and culture worked against 
the third. The second was the only alternative left open, 
and it was adopted. While the Rg-Veda describes the 
period of conflict between the fair-skinned Aryans and the 
dark Dasyus, which Indian mythology makes into a strife 
of Devas and Raksasas, the Atharva-Veda speaks to us of 
the period when the conflict is settled and the two are trying 
to live in harmony by mutual give and take. The spirit of 
accommodation naturally elevated the religion of the primi- 
tive tribes but degraded the Vedic religion by introducing 
into it sorcery and witchcraft. The worship of spirits and 
stars, trees and mountains and other superstitions of jungle 
tribes crept into the Vedic religion. The effort of the Vedic 
Aryan to educate the uncivilised resulted in the corruption 
of the ideal which he tried to spread. In his Introduction 
to the translation of the selections from the Atharva-Veda, 
Bloomfield remarks: " Even witchcraft is part of the Hindu’s 
religion; it had penetrated and become intimately blended 
with the holiest Vedic rites; the broad current of popular

religion and superstition has infiltrated itself through number- 
less channels into the higher religion that is presented by 
the Brahmin priests, and it may be presumed that the priests 
were neither able to cleanse their own religious beliefs from 
the mass of folk belief with which it was surrounded, nor 
is it at all likely that they found it in their interest to do 
so.” 1 Such are the revenges which the weak of the world 
have on the strong. The explanation of the miscellaneous 
character of the Hindu religion, which embraces all the 
intermediate regions of thought and belief from the wandering 
fancies of savage superstitions to the highest insight of daring 
thought, is here. From the beginning the Aryan religion 
was expansive, self-developing and tolerant. It went on 
accommodating itself to the new forces it met with in its 
growth. In this can be discerned a refined sense of true 
humility and sympathetic understanding. The Indian 
refused to ignore the lower religions and fight them out 
of existence. He did not possess the pride of the fanatic 
that his was the one true religion. If a god satisfies the 
human mind in its own way, it is a form of truth. None 
can lay hold upon the whole of truth. It can be won only 
by degrees, partially and provisionally. But they forgot 
that intolerance was sometimes a virtue. There is such a 
thing as Gresham’s law in religious matters also. When 
the Aryan and the non-Aryan religions, one refined and 
the other vulgar, the one good and the other base, met, 
there was the tendency for the bad to beat the good out 
of circulation.

Theology 

The religion of the Atharva-Veda is that of the primitive 
man, to whom the world is full of shapeless ghosts and 
spirits of death. When he realises his helplessness against 
the natural forces, the precariousness of his own existence 
so constantly subject to death, he makes death and disease, 
failure of monsoon and earthquake, the playground of his

fancy. The world becomes crowded with goblins and 
gods, and the catastrophes of the world are traced to dis- 
satisfied spirits. When a man falls ill, the magician and 
not the physician is sent for, and he employs spells to entice 
the spirit away from the patient . 1 The terrific powers could 
only be appeased by bloody sacrifices, human and animal. 
The fear of death gave a loose rein to superstition. Madame 
Ragozin writes : “ We have here, as though in opposition 
to the bright, cheerful pantheon of beneficent deities, so 
trustingly and gratefully addressed by the Rsis of the 
Rg-Veda, a weird repulsive world of darkly scowling demons, 
inspiring abject fear such as never sprang from Aryan 
fancy.” 2 The religion of the Atharva-Veda is an amalgam 
of Aryan and non- Aryan ideals. The distinction between 
the spirit of the Rg-Veda and that of the Atharva-Veda is 
thus described by Whitney : “ In the Rg-Veda the gods 
are approached with reverential awe, indeed, but with 
love and confidence also ; a worship is paid them which 
exalts the offerer of it ; the demons embraced under the 
general name Raksas are objects of horror, whom the 
gods ward off and destroy ; the divinities of the Atharva 
are regarded rather with a kind of cringing fear, as powers 
whose wrath is to be deprecated and whose favour curried ; 
it knows a whole host of imps and hobgoblins, in ranks and 
classes, and addresses itself to them directly, offering them 
homage to induce them to abstain from doing harm. The 
mantra, prayer, which in the older Veda is the instrument 
of devotion, is here rather the tool of superstition ; it wrings 
from the unwilling hands of the gods the favours which of 
old their goodwill to men induced them to grant, or by 
simple magical power obtains the fulfilment of the utterer’s 
wishes. The most prominent feature of the Atharva is the 
multitude of incantations which it contains. These are 
pronounced either by the person who is himself to be benefited 
or more often by the sorcerer for him, and are directed to the 
procuring of the greatest variety of desirable ends. . . . There

are hymns, too, in which a single rite or ceremony is taken 
up and exalted, somewhat in the same strain as the Soma 
in the Pavamana hymns of the Rg ; others of a speculative 
mystical character are not wanting ; yet their number is 
not so great as might naturally be expected, considering 
the development which the Hindu religion received in the 
periods following after that of the primitive Veda. It seems 
in the main that the Atharva is a popular rather than 
a priestly religion ; that, in making the transition from the 
Vedic to modern times, it forms an intermediate step, rather 
to the gross idolatries and superstitions of the ignorant 
mass than to the sublimated pantheism of the Brahmins.” 1 
A religion of magic, with its childish reliance on sorcery and 
witchcraft, takes the place of the purer Vedic religion ; the 
medicine man who knows how to scatter the spirits and 
control them holds the supreme position. We hear of great 
ascetics who obtain the mastery of nature by tapas. They 
reduce the elemental forces to their control by their asceticism. 
It was then well known that ecstatic conditions could be 
induced by the mortification of the body. Man can partici- 
pate in divine power by the hidden force of magic. The 
professors of magic and witchcraft were accepted by the 
Vedic seers, and their calling was dignified, with the result 
that magic and mysticism soon became confused. We find 
people sitting in the midst of five fires, standing on one 
leg, holding an arm above the head, all for the purpose of 
commanding the forces of nature and subduing the gods 
to their will. 

While the Atharva-Veda gives us an idea of demonology 
prevalent among the superstitious tribes of India, it is more 
advanced in some parts than the Rg-Veda, and has certain 
elements in common with the Upanisads and the Brahmanas. 
W e have the worship of Kala, time ; Kama, or love ; Skambha, 
or support. The greatest of them all is Skambha. He is 
the ultimate principle, called indiscriminately Prajapati, 
Purusa and Brahman. He includes all space and time, gods 
and Vedas and the moral powers. 2 Rudra is the lord of 
animals, and forms the point of linkage between the Vedic 
religion and the later Siva worship. Siva in the Rg-Veda

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


means only auspicious, but is not the name of a god ; the 
Rudra in the Rg-Veda is a malignant cattle-destroying 
deity. 1 Here he is the lord of all cattle, Pasupati. Prana 
is hailed as a life-giving principle of nature. 1 The 
doctrine of vital forces which figures so much in later 
Indian metaphysics is first mentioned here, and may possibly 
be a development of the principle of air of the Rg-Veda. 
While the deities of the Rg-Veda were of both sexes, the 
males were more prominent. In the Atharva-Veda the 
emphasis is shifted. No wonder in Tantric philosophies 
sex becomes the basis. The sacredness of the cow is recog- 
nised, and Brahma-loka is mentioned in the Atharva-Veda. 3 
Hell is known by its proper name. Naraka, with all its 
horror and tortures,4 is fairly familiar. 

Even the magical portion of the Atharva-Veda shows 
Aryan influence. If magic has to be accepted, the next 
best thing is to refine it. Bad magic is condemned and good 
magic encouraged. Many charms make for harmony in 
family and village life. The barbarous and bloody sacrifices 
which still persist in unaryanised parts of India are condemned. 
The old title of the Atharva-Veda, “ Atliarvangirasah,” shows 
that there were two different strata in it, one of Atharvan 
and the other of Angiras. The former refers to auspicious 
practices used for healing purposes. 5 The hostile practices 
belong to the Angirases. The first is medicine and the 
second is witchcraft, and the two are mixed up. 

The Atharva-Veda, the result of so much compromise, 
seemed to have had a good deal of trouble in obtaining 
recognition as a Veda. 6 It was regarded with contempt, 
since its central feature was sorcery. It contributed to the

The Yajur-Veda and the Brahmanas 

In the history of thought creative and critical epochs 
succeed each other. Periods of rich and glowing faith are 
followed by those of aridity and artificiality. When we 
pass from the Rg-Veda to the Yajur and the Sanaa Vedas 
and the Brahmanas, we feel a change in the atmosphere. 
The freshness and simplicity of the former give place to the 
coldness and artificiality of the latter. The spirit of religion 
is in the background, while its forms assume great importance. 
The need for prayer-books is felt. Liturgy is developed. 
The hymns are taken out of the Rg-Veda and arranged to 
suit sacrificial necessities. The priest becomes the lord. 
The Yajur-Veda gives the special formulas to be uttered 
when the altar is to be erected, etc., and the Saman describes 
the songs to be chanted at the sacrifice. These Vedas may 
be discussed along with the Brahmanas, since they all 
describe the sacrificial liturgy. The religion of the Yajur- 
Veda is a mechanical sacerdotalism. A crowd of priests 
conducts a vast and complicated system of external cere- 
monies to which symbolical significance is attached and to 
the smallest minutiae of which the greatest weight is given. 
The truly religious spirit could not survive in the stifling 
atmosphere of ritual and sacrifice. The religious feeling of 
the adoration of the ideal and the consciousness of guilt 
is lacking. Every prayer is coupled with a particular rite 
and aims at securing some material advantage. The formulas 
of the Yajur-Veda are full of dreary repetitions of petty 
requests for the goods of life. We cannot draw a sharp 
distinction between the age of the hymns of the Rg-Veda 
and the other Vedas and the Brahmanas, since the 
tendencies which became predominant in the latter were 
also found in the hymns of the Rg-Veda. We can say 
with some degree of certainty that the mass of the hymns 
of the Rg-Veda belongs to an age earlier than that of the 
Brahmanas.

Theology 

The Brahmanas, which form the second part of the 
Vedas, are the ritual textbooks intended to guide the priests 
through the complicated details of sacrificial rites. The 
chief of them are the Aitareya and the Satapatha. Differ- 
ences of detail in interpretation led to the formation of 
several schools of the Brahmanas. The period is marked 
by important changes in the religious evolution, which 
have permanently affected its future history. The emphasis 
on sacrifice, the observance of caste and the asramas, the 
eternity of the Veda, the supremacy of the priest, all belong 
to this age. 

We may begin by noting the additions made to the Vedic 
pantheon during the period. Visnu rose in importance 
in the Yajur-Veda. The Satapatha Brahmana makes him 
the personification of sacrifice. 1 The name Narayana also 
occurs in it, though it is only in the Taittiriya Aranyaka that 
the two Narayana and Visnu are brought into relation. 
Soiva makes his appearance, and is referred to under different 
names in the Kausitaki Brahmana. 2 Rudra has now a benig- 
nant form and is called Girisa.3 The Prajapati of the Rg-Veda 
becomes the chief god and the creator of the world. 
Visvakarman is identified with him. 4 Monotheism is incul- 
cated. Agni is very important. Brahmanaspati, the lord 
of prayer, becomes the leader of hymns and the organiser 
of rites. Brahman in the Rg-Veda means a hymn or a 
prayer addressed to God. From the subjective force which 
helped the seer to compose a prayer, it came to mean the 
object prayed for. From being the cause of prayer, we 
may say it came to mean the power of sacrifice ; and since 
in the Brahmanas the whole universe is regarded as pro- 
duced from sacrifice. Brahman came to signify the creative 
principle of the world. 5

TRANSITION TO THE UPANISADS 125 

The religion of the Brahmanas was purely formal. The 
poetic fire and the heartiness of the Vedic hymns are no 
more. Prayer comes to mean the muttering of mantras, 
or the utterance of sacred formulas. Loud petitions were 
thought necessary to rouse God to action. The words became 
artificial sounds with occult powers. Nobody could under- 
stand the mystery of it all, except the priest who claimed for 
himself the dignity of a god on earth. The one ambition 
was to become immortal like the gods, who attained that 
status by performing sacrifices . 1 All are subject to the 
influence of sacrifices. Without them, the sun would not 
rise. We can depose Indra from his throne in heaven if 
we perform a hundred horse-sacrifices. The sacrifices please 
the gods and profit men. Through them the gods become 
the friends of men. The sacrifices were made as a rule 
for gaining earthly profits and not heavenly bliss. A rigid 
soul-deadening, commercialist creed based on a contractual 
motive took the place of the simple devout religion of the 
Vedas . 2 The sacrifices of the Vedic hymns were a super- 
fluous appendage of prayers indicative of true religion 
but now they occupy the central place. Every act done, 
every syllable uttered at the ceremony is important. The 
religion of the Brahmanas became loaded with symbolic 
subtleties, and was ultimately lost in a soulless mechanism 
of idle rites and pedantries of formalism. 

The increasing dominance of the idea of sacrifice helped 
to exalt the position of the priests. The rsi of the Vedic 
hymns, the inspired singer of truth, becomes now the possessor 
of a revealed scripture, the repeater of a magical formula. 
The simple occupational division of the Aryans into the 
three classes assumes during the period an hereditary char- 
acter. The highly elaborate nature of the sacrificial cere- 
monial demands special training for the priestly office. 
The patriarchal head of the family could no more conduct 
the complex and minute system of the sacrificial ceremony. 
Priesthood became a profession and an hereditary one. The

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


priests who possessed the Vedic lore became the accredited 
intermediaries between gods and men and the dispensers 
of the divine grace. The yajamana, or the man for whom 
the rite is performed, stands aside. He is a passive agent 
supplying men, money and munitions ; the priest does 
the rest for him. Selfishness, with its longing for power, 
prestige and enjoyment, pressed its way in and dimmed 
the lustre of the original ideal. Attempts were made to 
mislead the people about the value of the offerings. A 
monopoly of functions and offices was secured. The ground 
was consolidated by the development of an extravagant 
symbolism. Language was used as if it was given to us 
to hide our thoughts. Only the priests could know the 
hidden meaning of things. No wonder the priest claimed 
for himself a divine dignity. “ Verily there are two kinds 
of gods ; for the gods themselves assuredly are gods, and 
then the priests who have studied and teach Vedic lore are 
the human gods.” 1 

We have here and there priests who seriously declare 
that they can bring about the death of him who actively 
employs them, though they have the moral sense to know 
that such an act is forbidden. 2 Another circumstance which 
further strengthened the priestly class was the necessity 
for the preservation of the Vedas which the Aryans brought 
with them, and round which, as we shall see in the sequel, 
a halo of sanctity grew. The Brahmin class was entrusted 
with their preservation. If the Vedas are to survive, the 
Brahmin must be true to his vocation. He imposed on 
himself accordingly severe conditions. “ A Brahmin un- 
learned in holy writ is extinguished in an instant like dry 
grass on fire.” 3 A Brahmin should shun worldly honour 
as he should shun poison. As a brahmacarin or student, 
he must control his passions, wait on his preceptor and 
beg for his food ; as a householder he must avoid wealth, 
speak the truth, lead a virtuous life, and keep himself pure 
in mind and body. The Brahmins felt that they should be 
faithful to the charge committed to their keeping. We 
need not speak of the wonderful way in which they have

preserved the Vedic tradition against all the dangerous 
accidents of history. Even to-day we can meet in the 
streets of Indian cities these walking treasure-houses of 
Vedic learning. Ihe rigid barriers of the later age are to 
be traced to historical accidents. In the age of the Brah- 
manas there was not much material distinction among the 
twice-born Aryans. They could all be educated in Vedic 
knowledge . 1 “ The sacrifice is like a ship sailing heaven- 
ward ; if there be a sinful priest in it that one priest would 
make it sink.” 2 So morality was not dismissed as altogether 
irrelevant. The Brahmin priests were neither wicked nor 
stupid. They had their own ideas of duty and righteousness 
which thej^ tried to preach to others. They were honest, 
upright men, who obeyed the rules, observed ceremonies 
and defended dogmas to the best of their ability. They 
had a sense of their calling and fulfilled it with zest and 
reverence. They framed elaborate codes of laws expressing 
their great love of learning and humanity. If they erred, 
it was because they were themselves fettered by a tradition. 
They were sincere souls whatever their hallucinations. 
They felt no shadow of doubt about the truth of their own 
orthodoxy. Their thought was paralysed by the conven- 
tions of the times. Yet no one would say that their pride 
in their own culture and civilisation was illegitimate at a 
time when the world around was steeped in barbarism and 
a thousand rude and tyrannous elements provoked them 
into this feeling. 

In the nature of things, a professional priesthood is 
always demoralising. But there is no reason to think that 
the Brahmin of India was more pompous and hypocritical 
than any other. As against the possible degeneration, 
protests were uttered by the true Brahmins, filled with the 
serene calm and the simple grandeur of the prophet soul 
even in that age. They raised a revolt against the ostenta- 
tion and hypocrisy of the selfish priest and blushed at the

unlearned in the Vedas, soon falls, even while living, to a condition of Sudra." 
In the Maliabharata we read : “ The order of Vanaprasthas, of sages who 
dwell in forests and live on fruits, roots and air, is prescribed for the three 
twice- born classes, the order of householders is prescribed for all.”

corruption of a great ideal. In any estimate of the priest- 
hood it is to be remembered that the Brahmins take into 
account the duties to be performed by the householder. There 
were other stages of the Vanaprastha and the Sannyasa where 
ritual is not binding at all. The Brahmanical rule would 
not have lasted if it had been felt as tyrannical or coercive. 
It commanded the confidence of the thinking, since it only 
insisted that everybody should fulfil his social duties. 

In later philosophy we hear much of what is called the 
authoritativeness of the Vedas or Sabdapramana. The 
darsanas or systems of philosophy are distinguished into 
orthodox or heterodox according as they accept or repudiate 
the authority of the Veda. The Veda is looked upon as a 
divine revelation. Though the Hindu apologists of a later 
day offer ingenious interpretations in support of Vedic 
authority, still, so far as the Vedic seers are concerned, they 
mean by it the highest truth revealed to a pure mind. 
“ Blessed are the pure in heart for they shall see God,” 
The rsi of the Vedic hymns calls himself not so much 
the composer of the hymns as the seer of them. 1 It is seeing 
with the mind’s eye or intuitive seeing. The rsi has his 
eyes unblinded by the fumes of passion, and so can see the 
truth which is not evident to the senses. He only transmits 
the truth which he sees but does not make.- The Veda 
is called “ fsruti,” or the rhythm of the infinite heard by 
the soul. The words drsti and sruti, which are the Vedic 
expressions, point out how the Vedic knowledge is not a 
matter of logical demonstration, but an intuitive insight. 
The poet’s soul hears or has revealed to it the truth in its 
inspired condition, when the mind is lifted above the narrow 
plane of the discursive consciousness. According to the 
Vedic seers the contents of the hymns are inspired and 
revelatory only in this sense. It is not their intention to 
suggest anything miraculous or supernatural. They even 
speak of the hymns as their own compositions or creations. 
They compare their work as poets with that of the carpenter,

'•‘seeing.” Cf. Vision (from Lalm video) ; Ideas (from Gnek eidos), wit.

the weaver, the rower, 1 * and give natural explanations of it. 
The hymns are shaped by the feelings of the human heart. 3 * * 
Sometimes they say they found the hymns. 3 They also 
attribute them to the exaltation consequent on the drink 
of Soma. 3 In a very humble spirit they hold the hymns 
to be God-given. 5 The idea of inspiration is not yet trans- 
formed into that of an infallible revelation. 

When we come to the Brahmanas we reach an age when 
the divine authority of the Vedas is accepted as a fact. 6 7 
The claim to divine revelation, and therefore eternal validity, 
is set up in this period. Its origin is easily intelligible. 
Writing was then unknown. There were neither printers 
nor publishers. The contents of the Vedas were transmitted 
by oral repetition through a succession of teachers. To 
ensure respect, some sanctity was attached to the Vedas. 
In the Rg-Veda Vak, or speech, was a goddess. And now they 
said from Vak the Vedas issued forth. Vak is the mother 
of the Vedas.7 In the Atharva-Veda the mantra is said 
to possess magical power. “ The Vedas issued like breath 
from the self-existent.” 8 The Vedas came to be regarded 
as divine revelation, communicated to the rsis, who 
were inspired men. Sabda, articulate sound, is considered 
eternal. The obvious effect of this view of the Vedas is that 
philosophy becomes scholastic. When the spoken word, 
real and alive, gets fixed in a rigid formula, its spirit expires. 
The authoritativeness of the Veda formulated so early in 
the history of Indian thought has affected the whole course 
of subsequent evolution. In later philosophy the tendency

(vol. iii. pp. 217-86) we have a collection of passages which clearly show 

that “ though some at least of the rsis appear to have imagined them- 
selves to be inspired by the gods in the expression of their religious emotion 
and ideas, they at the same time regarded the hymns as their own compo- 
sitions, or as (presumably) the eompositions of their forefathers, distinguish- 
ing between them as new and old and describing their own authorship in 
terms "which could only have been dictated by a consciousness of its reality/*

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


developed to interpret the unsystematic and not always 
consistent texts of the earlier age in line with set opinions. 
When once the tradition is regarded as sacred and infallible 
it must be represented as expressing or implying what is 
considered to be the truth. This accounts for the fact that 
the same texts are adduced in support of varying tenets 
and principles, mutually contradictory and inconsistent. 
If fidelity to dogma and diversity of view should live together, 
it is possible only through absolute freedom of interpretation, 
and it is here that the Indian philosophers show their 
ingenuity. It is surprising that, in spite of the tradition, 
Indian thought kept itself singularly free for a long time 
from dogmatic philosophising. The Indian thinkers first 
arrive at a system of consistent doctrine and then look 
about for texts of an earlier age to support their position. 
They either force them into such support or ingeniously 
explain them away. There has been one good effect of this 
Vedic tradition. It has helped to keep philosophy real 
and living. Instead of indulging in empty disputations 
and talking metaphysics which has no bearing on life, 
the Indian thinkers had a fixed foundation to go upon, the 
religious insight of the highest seers as expressed in the 
Vedas. It gave them a hold on the central facts of life, and 
no philosophy could afford to discard it. 


V 

Theories of Creation 

With regard to the theories of creation, though the lead 
of the Rg-Veda is generally followed, there are some fanciful 
accounts also mentioned. After the Rg-Veda, the Taittiriya 
Brahmana says, “ formerly nothing existed, neither heaven 
nor atmosphere nor earth.” Desire is the seed of existence. 
Prajapati desires offspring and creates. "Verily in the 
beginning Prajapati alone existed here. He thought with 
himself, how can I be propagated ? He toiled and practised 
austerities. He created living beings.” 1

Ethics 

In fairness to the religion of the Brahmanas, it is to be 
said that we find frequent traces in them of high moral 
sense and exalted sentiment. The conception of man’s 
duty first arises here. Man is said to owe some debts or 
duties to gods, men and animals. The duties are distin- 
guished into (i) those to the gods, (2) those to seers, (3) those 
to manes, (4) those to men, (5) and those to the lower crea- 
tion. He who discharges them all is the good man. No 
man can touch his daily meal without offering parts of it 
to gods, fathers, men and animals, and saying his daily 
prayers. This is the way to live in harmony with the world 
around him. Life is a round of duties and responsibilities. 
The conception is certainly high and noble whatever the 
actual filling of the ideal may be. Unselfishness can be 
practised in all our acts. In the 5 atapatha Brahmana, the 
sacrifice of all things, sarvamedha, is taught as a means to 
the attainment of spiritual freedom. 1 Godliness is of course 
the first duty. It does not consist in the mechanical perform- 
ance of fixed ritual. It consists in praise and good works. 
Godliness means trying to be divine as much as possible. 
Truth-speaking is an essential part of godliness. It is a 
religious and moral duty. Agni is the lord of vows and Vak 
the lord of speech. Both will be displeased if truthfulness is 
not observed. 2 We notice already the symbolical interpre- 
tation of sacrifices. There are passages which point to the 
essential futility of works. “ Yonder world cannot be 
obtained by sacrificial gifts or by asceticism by the man 
who does not know this. That state belongs only to him 
who has this knowledge.” 3 Adultery is condemned as 
a sin against the gods, especially Varuna. In all cases of 
evil-doing, confession is supposed to make the guilt less .4 
Asceticism is also held up as a worthy ideal, for the

gods are supposed to have obtained divine rank by 
austerity. 1 

The asrama dharma was introduced or more correctly 
formulated in this age. 2 The Vedic Aryan’s life has the 
four stages or asramas, as they are called, of (i) Brahmacarin 
or student, when he is expected to study one or more Vedas; 

(2) the Grhastha or the householder, when he has to fulfil 
the duties mentioned in the scriptures, social and sacrificial; 

(3) the Vanaprastha or the hermit, when the devotee spends 
his time in fasting and penance; and (4) the Sannyasin 
or the ascetic, who has no fixed abode. He is without any 
possessions or property and longs for union with God. The 
four parts of the Veda, the hymns, the Brahmanas, the Aran- 
yakas and the Upanisads answer to the four stages of the 
Vedic Aryan’s life . 3 Beneath the formalism of ceremonial 
worship there was at work a spirit of true religion and morality, 
from which the heart of man obtained satisfaction. It 
is this ethical basis which has helped the Brahmanical 
religion with all its weaknesses to endure so long. Side 
by side with its insistence on the outer, there was also the 
emphasis on inner purity. Truth, godliness, honour to 
parents, kindness to animals, love of man, abstinence from 
theft, murder and adultery, were inculcated as the essentials 
of a good life. 

The institution of caste is not the invention of an un- 
scrupulous priesthood, but a natural evolution conditioned 
by the times. It was consolidated in the period of the 
Brahmanas. The Purusa Sukta, though a part of the 
Rg-Veda, really belongs to the age of the Brahmanas. It is 
clear that there were then inter-marriages between the 
Aryans and the Dasyus.t To avoid too much confusion of 
blood, an appeal was made to the pride of the Aryans. 
What was originally a social institution became a religious 
one. A divine sanction was given to it, and the laws of

caste became immutable. The flexibility of the original 
class system gave way to the rigidity of the caste. In the 
early Vedic period the priests formed a separate profession, 
but not a separate caste. Any Aryan could become a 
priest, and the priestly class was not necessarily superior 
to the warrior or the trading classes. Sometimes they were 
even treated with contempt. 1 But now the exclusiveness 
born of pride becomes the basis of caste. It tended to 
suppress free thought and retarded the progress of specula- 
tion. The moral standard sank. The individual who 
transgressed the rules of caste was a rebel and an outcaste. 
The Sudras were excluded from the highest religion. Mutual 
contempt increased. “ These are the words of Ksatriya,” 
is a typical Brahmin way of characterising the words of 
an opponent. 2

Eschatology 

In the Brahmanas we do not find any one view about 
the future life. The distinction between the path of the 
fathers and that of the devas is given. 3 Rebirth on earth 
is sometimes looked upon as a blessing and not an evil to 
be escaped from. It is promised as a reward for knowing 
some divine mystery. 4 But the most dominant view is 
that of immortality in heaven, the abode of the gods. 
" He who sacrifices thus obtains perpetual prosperity and 
renown and conquers for himself a union with the two 
gods Aditya and Agni and an abode in the same sphere.” 5 
Particular sacrifices enable us to reach the spheres of par- 
ticular gods. 6 Even the stars are regarded as the abode of 
the dead. It is individual existence, though in a better 
world, that is the aim still. “ In the Brahmanas immortality, 
or at least longevity, is promised to those who rightly under- 
stand and practise the rites of sacrifice, while those who are 
deficient in this respect depart before time to the next world,

where they are weighed in a balance, 1 and receive good and 
evil according to their deeds. The more sacrifices any one 
has offered, the more ethereal is the body he obtains, or as 
the Brahmana expresses it, 2 the more rarely does he need 
to eat. j.n other texts, on the contrary,3 it is promised as the 
highest reward that the pious man shall be born in the next 
world, with his entire body, sarva tanuh.” 1 Thus far the 
difference between the Vedic and the Brahmanical views 
is that while according to the Rg-Veda the sinner is reduced 
to nothing while the virtuous obtain immortality, in the 
Brahmanas both are born again to undergo the results of their 
actions. As Weber puts it : “ Whereas in the oldest times 
immortality in the abodes of the blessed, where milk and 
honey flow, is regarded as the reward of virtue or wisdom, 
whilst the sinner or the fool is, after a short life, doomed 
to the annihilation of the personal existence, the doctrine 
of the Brahmanas is that after death all are born again, 
in the next world, where they are recompensed according 
to their deeds, the good being rewarded and the wicked 
punished.” 5 The suggestion is that there is only one life 
after this, and its nature is determined by our conduct here. 
“ A man is born into the world which he has made.” 6 
" Whatever food a man eats in this w’orld by that food he 
is eaten in the next world.” 7 Good and evil deeds find their 
corresponding rewards and punishments in a future life. 
Again: " Thus have they done to us in yonder world, and 
so we do to them again in this world.” 8 Gradually the idea 
of an equalising justice developed. The world of the 
fathers, as in the Rg-Veda, was one of the ways, but the 
distinction arose between the Vedic gods and their world 
and the way of the fathers and their world of retributive 
justice. We have not yet the idea of a recurrence of births

men of the mild disposition and reflective spirit of the Indians 
it would not appear that reward and punishment could be 
eternal. They would conceive that it must be possible by 
atonement and purification to become absolved from the 
punishment of the sins committed in this short life. And 
in the same way they could not imagine that the reward of 
virtues practised during the same brief period could continue 
for ever.” When we finish experiencing our rewards and 
punishments, it is suggested that we die to that life and 
are reborn on earth. The natural rhythm by which life 
gives birth to death and death to life leads us to the con- 
ception of a beginningless and endless circuit. 1 The true 
ideal becomes redemption from the bondage of life and death 
or release from samsara. “ He who sacrifices to the gods 
does not gain so great a world as he who sacrifices to the 
Atman.” 2 “ He who reads the Vedas is freed from dying 

again and attains to a sameness of nature with Brahman.” 3 
Death with birth for its cause seems to have become a 
thing to be avoided. Later we find the conception that 
those who merely perform rites without knowledge are born 
again and repeatedly become the food of death. 4 In another 
passage 5 there is suggested the Upanisad conception of 
a higher state than that of desire and its fulfilment, the 
condition of true immortality. “ This soul is the end of 
all this. It abides in the midst of all the waters ; it is 
supplied with all objects of desire ; it is free from desire, and 
possesses all objects of desire, for it desires nothing.” “ By 
knowledge men ascend to that condition in which desires 
have passed away. Thither gifts do not reach nor austere 
devotees who are destitute of knowledge. For one who 
does not possess this knowledge does not attain that world 
by gifts or by rigorous abstention. It pertains only to those 
who have such knowledge.” 6 The Brahmanas contain all 
the suggestions necessary for the development of the doctrine 
of rebirth. They are, however, only suggestions, while

individual immortality is the main tendency. It is left 
for the Upanisads to systematise these suggestions into 
the doctrine of rebirth. While the conceptions of karma 
and rebirth are unquestionably the work of the Aryan 
mind, it need not be denied that the suggestions may have 
come from the aborigines, who believed that after death their 
souls lived in animal bodies. 

In spite of suggestions of a higher ethics and religion, it 
must be said that the age was, on the whole, one of Pharisaism, 
in which people were more anxious about the completion of 
their sacrifices than the perfection of their souls. There 
was need for a restatement of the spiritual experience, the 
central meaning of which was obscured by a legalistic code 
and conventional piety. This the Upanisads undertake.

The Upanisads 

The Upanisads 1 form tlie concluding portions of the 
Veda, and are therefore called the Veda-anta, or the end 

1 The word Upanisad comes from upa ni sad, " sitting down near.” It means 
“ sitting down near ” the teacher to receive instruction. It gradually came to

of the Veda, a denomination which suggests that they 
contain the essence of the Vedic teaching. They are the 
foundations on which most of the later philosophies and 
religions of India rest. “ There is no important form of 
Hindu thought, heterodox Buddhism included, which is 
not rooted in the Upanisads.” 1 Later systems of philo- 
sophy display an almost pathetic anxiety to accommodate 
their doctrines to the views of the Upanisads, even if 
they cannot father them all on them. Every revival of 
idealism in India has traced its ancestry to the teaching 
of the Upanisads. Their poetry and lofty idealism have 
not as yet lost their power to move the minds and sway 
the hearts of men. They contain the earliest records of 
Indian speculation. The hymns and the liturgical books 
of the Veda are concerned more with the religion and prac- 
tice than with the thought of the Aryans. We find in the 
Upanisads an advance on the Saiiihita mythology, Brahmana 
hair-splitting, and even Aranyaka theology, though all these 
stages are to be met with. The authors of the Upanisads 
transform the past they handle, and the changes they effect 
in the Vedic religion indicate the boldness of the heart that 
beats only for freedom. The aim of the Upanisads is 
not so much to reach philosophical truth as to bring peace 
and freedom to the anxious human spirit. Tentative solu- 
tions of metaphysical questions are put forth in the form 
of dialogues and disputations, though the Upanisads are 
essentially the outpourings or poetic deliverances of philo- 
sophically tempered minds in the face of the facts of life. 
They express the restlessness and striving of the human 
mind to grasp the true nature of reality. Not being sys- 
tematic philosophy, or the production of a single author, 
or even of the same age, they contain much that is incon- 


mean what we receive from the teacher, a sort of secret doctrine or rahasyam. 
Sometimes it is made to mean what enables us to destroy error, and approach 
truth. £amkara, in his introduction to the Taittiriya Upanisad, says: 
" Knowledge of Brahman is called Upanisad because in the case of those 
who devote themselves to it, the bonds of conception, birth, decay, etc., 
become unloosed, or because it destroys them altogether, or because it leads 
the pupil very near to Brahman, or because therein the highest God is 
seated.” See Pandit, March, 1872, p. 254.

sistent and unscientific; but if that were all, we cannot 
justify the study of the Upanisads. They set forth funda- 
mental conceptions which are sound and satisfactory, and 
these constitute the means by which their own innocent 
errors, which through exclusive emphasis have been exag- 
gerated into fallacious philosophies, can be corrected. Not- 
withstanding the variety of authorship and the period of 
time covered by the composition of these half-poetical and 
half-philosophical treatises, there is a unity of purpose, 
a vivid sense of spiritual reality in them all, which become 
clear and distinct as we descend the stream of time. 
They reveal to us the wealth of the reflective religious mind 
of the times. In the domain of intuitive philosophy their 
achievement is a considerable one. Nothing that went 
before them for compass and power, for suggestiveness 
and satisfaction, can stand comparison with them. Their 
philosophy and religion have satisfied some of the greatest 
thinkers and intensely spiritual souls. We do not agree 
with Gough’s estimate that “ there is little that is spiritual 
in all this,” or that " this empty intellectual conception, 
void of spirituality, is the highest form that the Indian 
mind is capable of.” Professor J. S. Mackenzie, with truer 
insight, says that “ the earliest attempt at a constructive 
theory of the cosmos, and certainly one of the most inter- 
esting and remarkable, is that which is set forth in the 
Upanisads.” 1

The Teaching of the Upanisads 

It is not easy to decide what the Upanisads teach. 
Modern students of the Upanisads read them in the light 
of this or that preconceived theory. Men are so little 
accustomed to trust their own judgment that they take 
refuge in authority and tradition. Though these are safe 
enough guides for conduct and life, truth requires insight 
and judgment as well. A large mass of opinion inclines 
to-day to the view of Sarhkara, who in his commentaries 

I E.R.E., vol. viii., p. 597 ; see also Hume, The Thirteen Principal 
Upanisads, p. 2. 



140 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

on the Upanisads, the Bhagavadgita and the Vedanta 
Sutras, has elaborated a highly subtle system of non-dualistic 
metaphysics. Another is equally vehement that Jsamkara 
has not said the last word on the subject, and that a philo- 
sophy of love and devotion is the logical outcome of the 
teaching of the Upanisads. Different commentators, start- 
ing with particular beliefs, force their views into the Upani- 
sads and strain their language so as to make it consistent 
with their own special doctrines. When disputes arise, 
all schools turn to the Upanisads. Thanks to the obscurity 
as well as the richness, the mystic haze as well as the sug- 
gestive quality of the Upanisads, the interpreters have been 
able to use them in the interests of their own religion and 
philosophy. The upanisads had no set theory of philosophy 
or dogmatic scheme of theology to propound. They hint 
at the truth in life, but not as yet in science or philosophy. 
So numerous are their suggestions of truth, so various are 
their guesses at God, that almost anybody may seek in 
them what he wants and find what he seeks, and every 
school of dogmatics may congratulate itself on finding its 
own doctrine in the sayings of the Upanisads. In the 
history of thought it has often happened that a philosophy 
has been victimised by a traditional interpretation that 
became established at an early date, and has thereafter 
prevented critics and commentators from placing it in its 
proper perspective. The system of the Upanisads has 
not escaped this fate. The Western interpreters have followed 
this or that commentator. Gough follows Samkara’s inter- 
pretation. In his Preface to the Philosophy of the Upanisads 
he writes : “ The greatest expositor of the philosophy of 
the Upanisads is Samkara or ^amkaracarya. The teaching 
of Samkara himself is the natural and the legitimate inter- 
pretation of the philosophy of the Upanisads." 1 Max 
Muller adopts the same standpoint. " We must remember 
that the orthodox view of the Vedanta is not what we 
should call evolution, but illusion. Evolution of the Brahman 
or parinama is heterodox, illusion or vivarta is orthodox 
Vedanta. ... To put it metaphorically, the world according 
to the orthodox Vedantin does not proceed from Brahman

as a tree from a germ, but as a mirage from the rays of 
the sun.” 1 Deussen accepts the same view. We shall try 
to ascertain the meaning which the authors of the Upanisads 
intended, and not what later commentators attributed to 
them. The latter give us an approximately close idea of 
how the Upanisads were interpreted in later times, but 
not necessarily a true insight into the philosophic synthesis 
which the ancient seekers had. But the problem is, do 
the thoughts of the Upanisads hang together ? Could 
all of them be traced to certain commonly acknowledged 
principles about the general make-up of the world ? We 
are not so bold as to answer this question in the affirmative. 
These writings contain too many hidden ideas, too many 
possible meanings, too rich a mine of fancies and conj ectures, 
that we can easily understand how different systems can 
draw their inspiration from the same source. The Upanisads 
do not contain any philosophic synthesis as such, of the 
type of the system of Aristotle or of Kant or of Samkara. 
They have the consistency of intuition rather than of logic, 
and there are certain fundamental ideas which, so to say, 
form the first sketch of a philosophic system. Out of these 
ideas a coherent and consistent doctrine might be developed. 
It is, however, difficult to be confident that one’s working 
up of elements which knew neither method nor arrangement 
is the correct one, on account of the obscurity of many 
passages. Yet with the higher ideals of philosophic expo- 
sition in view, we shall consider the Upanisad ideas of 
the universe and of man’s place in it.

Number and Date of the Upanisads 
The Upanisads are generally accounted to be 108 in 
number, of which about ten are the chief, on which Samkara 
has commented. These are the oldest and the most authori- 
tative. We cannot assign any exact date to them. The 
earliest of them are certainly pre-Buddhistic, a few of them are 
after Buddha. It is likely that they were composed between 
the completion of the Vedic hymns and the rise of Buddhism 
(that is the sixth century b.c.) The accepted dates 
« S.B.E., vol. xv., p. xxvii. 



142 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

for the early Upanisads are 1000 b.c. to 300 b.c. Some 
of the later Upanisads on which Samkara has commented 
are post-Buddhistic, and belong to about 400 or 300 B.c. 
The oldest Upanisads are those in prose. These are non- 
sectarian. The Aitareya, the Kausitaki, the Taittirfya, 
the Chandogya, the Brhadaranyaka, and parts of the 
Kena are the early ones, while verses 1-13 of the Kena, 
and iv. 8-21 of the Brhadaranyaka form the transition 
to the metrical Upanisads, and may be put down as 
later additions. The Kathopanisad is later still. We find 
in it elements of the Samkhya and the Yoga systems. 1 
It also quotes freely from the other Upanisads and 
the Bhagavadgita. 2 The Mandukya is the latest of the 
pre-sectarian Upanisads. The Atharva-Veda Upanisads 
are also of later growth. MaitrayanI Upanisad has 

elements in it of both the Samkhya and the Yoga systems. 
The Svetasvatara was composed at the period when the 
several philosophical theories were fermenting. It shows in 
many passages an acquaintance with the technical terms 
of the orthodox systems and mentions many of their pro- 
minent doctrines. It seems to be interested in presenting 
a theistic syncretism of the Vedanta, the Samkhya and the 
Yoga. There is more of pure speculation present in the 
early prose Upanisads, while in the later ones there is 
more of religious worship and devotion .3 In presenting

3 See i. 2. 5 ; and Mundaka, ii. 8 ; i. 3-7, and Gita, ii. 29 ; ii. 18-19, and 
ii. 19-20 and ii. 23, and Mundaka, iii. 2-3, Gita, i. 53. Some scholars are 
inclined to the view that the Katha upanisad is older than the Mundaka and 
the Gita. 

3 Deussen arranges the Upanisads in the following order : — 

1. Ancient prose Upanisads : Brhadaranyaka, Chandogya, Tait- 

tiriya, Aitareya, Kausitaki, Kena (partly in prose). 

2. Verse Upanisads ; Isa, Katha, Mundaka and Svetasvatara. 

3. Later prose : Prasna and MaitrayanI. 

All these, excepting the MaitrayanI, are called the classical Upanisads. 

About the MaitrayanI, Professor Macdonell writes : “ Its many quota- 
tions from the other Upanisads, the occurrence of several later words, the 
developed Samkhya doctrine presupposed by it, distinct references to the 
anti-Yedic heretical schools, all combine to render the late character of this 
work undoubted. It is, in fact, a summing up of the old upanisadic doc- 
trines with an admixture of ideas derived from the Samkhya system and 
from Buddhism” (Sanskrit Literature, p. 230). 

Nrsmhottaratapanlya is one of the twelve Upanisads explained by 
Vidyaranya in his “ Sarvopanisadarthanubhutipraka<a."

the philosophy of the Upanisads, we shall take our stand 
mainly on the pre-Buddhistic ones, and strengthen our 
views as derived from them by those of the post-Buddhistic 
ones. The main Upanisads for our purposes are the 
Chandogya and the Brhadaranyaka, the Taittiriya and 
the Aitareya, the Kausltaki and the Kena ; the Isa and 
the Mandukya come next.

The Thinkers of the Upanisads 

Unfortunately, we know very little of the lives of the 
great thinkers whose reflections are embodied in the Upani- 
sads. So careless were they of personal fame and so 
anxious for the spread of truth, that they fathered their 
views on the honoured deities and heroes of the Vedic 
period. Prajapati and Indra, Narada and Sanatkumara 
figure as dialecticians. When the history of the great 
thinkers of the Upanisad period with their distinctive 
contributions comes to be written, the following names, 
if we leave aside the mythical ones, will stand out : Mahidasa 
Aitareya, Raikva, Sandilya, Satyakama Jabala, Jaivali, 
Uddalaka, Svetaketu, Bharadvaja, Gargyayana, Pratar- 
dana, Balaki, Ajatasatru, Varuna, Yajnavalkya, Gargi and 
Maitreyi. 1

The Hymns of the Rg-Veda and the Upanisads 

In view of the distinctive character of their contents, 
the Upanisads are regarded as a class of literature inde- 
pendent of the Vedic hymns and the Brahmanas. The 
simple faith in gods of the hymns was, as we saw, displaced 
by the mechanical sacerdotalism of the Brahmanas. The 
Upanisads feel that the faith that ends in a church is not 
enough. They attempt to moralise the religion of the

their views in the excellent work of my friend and colleague, Dr. Barua, 
Pre-Buddhistic Indian Philosophy. 



144 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

Vedas without disturbing its form. The advance of the 
Upanisads on the Vedas consists in an increased emphasis 
on the monistic suggestions of the Vedic hymns, a shifting 
of the centre from the outer to the inner world, a protest 
against the externalism of the Vedic practices and an in- 
difference to the sacredness of the Veda. 

Asiid all the confused ferment of Vedic devotions a 
certain principle of unity and comprehension was asserting 
itself. In some hymns the conception of a single central 
power was actually formulated. The Upanisads carry out 
this tendency. They recognise only one spirit — almighty, 
infinite, eternal, incomprehensible, self-existent, the creator, 
preserver and destroyer of the world. He is the light, 
lord and life of the universe, one without a second, and 
the sole object of worship and adoration. The half -gods 
of the Veda die and the true God arrives. “ How many 
gods are there really, O Yajnavalkya ? ” “ One,” he said. 1 * 

“ Now answer us a further question : Agni, Vayu, Aditya, 
Kala (time), which is breath (Prana), Anna (food), Brahma, 
Rudra, Visnu. Thus do some meditate on him, some on 
another. Say which of these is the best for us ? ” And 
he said to them : “ These are but the chief manifestations 
of the highest, the immortal, the incorporeal Brahman. . . . 
Brahman, indeed, is all this, and a man may meditate on, 
worship or discard also those which are its manifestations.” 3 
The visible infinite (objective) and the invisible infinite 
(subjective) are taken up into the spiritual whole. 

The polytheistic conceptions were too deeply rooted in 
the Indian consciousness to be easily overthrown. The 
many gods were subordinated to the One. Without Brah- 
man, Agni cannot burn a blade of grass, Vayu cannot blow 
a whisp of straw. “ For fear of him, fire burns, for fear 
of him the sun shines, and for fear of him the winds, the 
clouds and death perform their office.” 3 Sometimes the 
many gods are made parts of one whole. The five house- 
holders led by Uddalaka approach king Asvapati, who

asked each of them, Whom do you meditate on as the 
Self ? The first answered heaven ; the second, the sun ; 
the third, air ; the fourth, ether ; the fifth, water ; and 
the king replies that each of them worshipped only a part 
of the truth. Heaven is the head, the sun the eye, the 
air the breath, the ether the trunk, the water the bladder, 
and the earth the feet of the central reality, which is pictured 
as the world-soul. Compromise between the philosophic 
faith of the few and the fancied superstition of the crowds 
is the only possible reconciliation ; we cannot abolish the 
old forms, for that would be to ignore the fundamental 
nature of humanity, as well as the patent differences, in 
the moral and intellectual states of believers who were not 
capable of acquiring at once the highest wisdom. Another 
factor also determined the attitude of the Upanisads. Their 
aim was not science or philosophy, but right living. They 
wished to liberate the spirit from the trammels of the flesh, 
that it might enjoy communion with God. Intellectual 
discipline was subsidiary to holiness of life. Besides, there 
was the feeling of reverence for the past. The Vedic seers 
were the ancients of blessed memory, whose doctrines it 
was impious to attack. In this w'ay the Upanisads sought 
to square a growing idealistic philosophy with the dogmas 
of a settled theology. 

The sources of man’s spiritual insight are two-fold : 
objective and subjective — the w'onders of the world without 
and the stress of the human soul. In the Vedas the vast 
order and movement of nature engages attention. Their gods 
represent cosmic forces. In the Upanisads we return to 
explore the depths of the inner world. “ The self-existent 
pierced the openings of the senses so that they turn outwards ; 
therefore man looks outward, not inward into himself ; 
some wise man, however, with his eyes closed and wishing 
for immortality, saw' the self behind.” 1 From the outward 
physical fact, attention shifts to the inner immortal self 
situated at the back of the mind, as it w r ere. We need 
not look to the sky for the bright light ; the glorious fire 
is within the soul. The soul of man is the keyhole 
to the landscape of the whole universe, the Akasa within

the heart, the limpid lake which mirrors the truth. The 
altered outlook brought about a consequential change. 
Not the so-called gods, but the true living God, the Atman 
has to be worshipped. God’s dwelling-place is the heart 
of man. “ Brahmanah koso’si,” 1 Thou art the sheath of 
Brahman. “ Whosoever worships another deity, in such a 
manner as he is another, another ‘ I am,’ does not know.” * 
The inner immortal self and the great cosmic power are 
one and the same. Brahman is the Atman and the Atman 
is the Brahman. The one supreme power through which 
all things have been brought into being is one with the 
inmost self in each man’s heart. 3 The Upanisads do not 
uphold the theory of grace in the same spirit as the Vedas 
do. We do not have appeals to the Vedic gods, who were 
the sources of material prosperity for increase of happiness, 
but only prayers for deliverance from sorrow. 

The emphasis on sorrow is sometimes interpreted as 
indicating an extravagant pessimism on the part of the 
Indian rsis. It is not so. The religion of the Vedas 
certainly was more joyous, but it was a lower form of religion, 
where thought never penetrated beneath the husk of things. 
It was a religion expressing the delight of man at being 
in a world full of pleasures. The gods were feared and also 
trusted. Life on earth was simple and sweet innocence. 
The spiritual longing of the soul rebukes light-hearted 
joyousness and provokes reflection on the purpose of man’s 
existence. Discontent with the actual is the necessary 
precondition of every moral change and spiritual rebirth. 
The pessimism of the Upanisads is the condition of all 
philosophy. Discontent prevails to enable man to effect 

« Tait. Up. * Brh. Up., i. 4, 10. 

S See Chandogya, iii. 14. Cf. Augustine: “ I asked the earth for God, 
and it answered me, ‘ I am not He ’ ; I asked the sea and the depths and 
the creeping things, and they answered, ' We are not the God, seek thou 
above us.' I asked the breezy gales, and the airy universe, and all its 
denizens replied, ‘ Anaximenes is mistaken, I am not God ' ; I asked the 
heaven, sun, moon, stars, ‘ Neither are we,’ say they, ‘ the God whom thou 
seekest ’ ; and I asked unto all things which stand about the gateways of 
my flesh (the senses), ‘ Ye have told me of my God, that ye are not He; tell 
me something of Him,’ and they cried with a loud voice, ‘ He made us.' ” 
The search goes on until the inward self is questioned, when the answer is : 
“ Thy God is unto Lhee, even the life of thy life ” ( Confessions , x. chap. 6). 



PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 147 


an escape from it. If there is no way of escape, if no deliver- 
ance is sought after, then dissatisfaction is mischievous. 
The pessimism of the Upanisads has not developed to 
such an extent as to suppress all endeavour and generate 
inertia. There was enough faith in life to support all 
genuine search for truth. In the words of Barth : “ The 
Upanisads are much more instinct with the spirit of specu- 
lative daring than the sense of suffering and weariness.” 1 
" Within the limits of the Upanisads there are indeed 
few explicit references to the misery of the life caught in 
the ceaseless cycle of death and birth. And its authors 
are saved from pessimism by the joy they feel at the message 
of redemption they proclaim.” 2 The formulation of the 
theory of samsara or rebirth is no proof that the Upanisads 
are pessimistic. Life on earth is the means of self-perfection. 
We have to undergo the discipline of samsara in our efforts 
towards the higher joy and the complete possession of 
spiritual truth. That which gives zest to life is the supreme 
motive of the joy of self-conquest. Samsara is only a 
succession of spiritual opportunities. Life is a stage in 
spiritual perfection, a step in the passage to the infinite. 
It is the time for preparing the soul for eternity. Life is 
no empty dream and the world no delirium of spirit. In 
the later versions of rebirth in Indian thought we miss 
this ennobling ideal, and birth becomes the result of an 
error of the soul and sariisara a dragging chain. 

At the stage of life represented by the Brahmanas, the 
simple religion of the Vedic hymns was one of sacrifices. 
Men’s relations with the gods were mechanical, a question 
of give and take, profit and loss. The revival of spirituality 
was the need of the age immersed in formalism. In the 
Upanisads we find a return to the fresh springs of 
spiritual life. They declare that the soul will not obtain 
salvation by the performance of sacrifices. It can be ob- 
tained only by the truly religious life, based on an insight into 
the heart of the universe. Perfection is inward and spiritual, 
not outward and mechanical. We cannot make a man 
clean by washing his shirt. A consciousness of the identity

of one’s own soul with the great All-soul is the essence of 
a truly spiritual life. The uselessness of ritual, the futility 
of sacrifices as means to salvation are brought out. God 
is to be honoured by spiritual worship and not external 
ceremony. We cannot save ourselves by praising God. 
We cannot impress Him by sacrifices. The authors 
of the Upanisads had a sufficient sense of the historic 
to know that their protest would become ineffective 
if it should demand a revolution in things. They 
therefore ask only for a change in the spirit. They 

reinterpret sacrifices and allegorise them. In some passages 1 
we are asked to meditate on the horse-sacrifice. 1 This 
meditative effort helps us to realise the meaning of the 
sacrifice, and it is said to be quite as valuable as making 
a sacrifice. By giving detailed descriptions of the kind of 
plank, the nature of the wood, etc., they show that they 
are not indifferent to the sacrificial religion. While adhering 
to the forms they try to refine them. They say that all 
sacrifices are for the sake of realising the self of man. Life 
itself is a sacrifice. " The true sacrifice is man ; his first 
twenty-four years are his morning libation ... in hunger, 
in thirst, in abstinence from pleasure standeth his conse- 
cration. ... In his eating and drinking and in his pleasures 
he keeps a holy festival, and in his laughter and feasting 
and marrying he sings hymns of praise. Self-discipline, 
generosity, straightforwardness, ahimsa,3 and truth in 
speech, these are his payments, and the bath of purification 
when the sacrifice is over is death.” 4 We are told how 
the divine nature every day sacrifices itself ; by its sacrifice 
do we live. Sacrifice is made to mean not feasting but 
renunciation. Make every action, every feeling and every 
thought an offering to God. Let your life be one sacrament 
or yajna. Sometimes we are told that the sacrifices are

to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are cast 
out to thy house ? When thou seest the naked, that thou cover him, and 
that thou hide not thyself from thine own flesh ? " See Plato : Euthyphron,

PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 149 

necessary as preparations for the higher path. Nobody can 
tread the higher road without fulfilling the requirements of 
the lower. Sacrifices are necessary for the unenlightened, 
though they alone will not do. They give us admission 
to the world of the fathers, which after a temporary sojourn 
in the moon leads back to a new earthly existence. Cere- 
monialism is contrasted with spiritual worship. 1 There 
are occasions when the sacrificial and priestly religion 
strikes them as superficial, and then they give vent to all 
their irony. They describe a procession of dogs to march 
like a procession of the priests, each holding the tail of the 
other in front and saying, “ Om ! Let us eat. Om, let us 
drink . . . etc.” J Thus the rigid ritual of the Brahmanas, 
which gave little comfort to the weak heart of man, was 
held in check in the Upanisads. 

The attitude of the Upanisads is not favourable to 
the sacredness of the Vedas. Like the rationalistic thinkers 
of a later day, they adopt a double attitude towards Vedic 
authority. They consider the Veda to be of supernatural 
origin, as when they say, “ Just as when a fire is laid 
with damp wood, clouds of smoke spread all around, so in 
truth from this great being, has been breathed forth the 
Rg-Veda, the Yajur-Veda, the Sama-Veda, the hymns of the 
Atharvas and the Angirasas, the narratives, the histories, 
the sciences, the mystical problems, the poems, the proverbs, 
and the expositions — all these have been breathed forth 
from Him.” 3 It is also recognised that the Vedic know- 
ledge is much inferior to the true divine insight, 4 and will 
not liberate us. Narada said: “ I know the Rg-Veda, Sir, 
the Yajur, the Sama-Veda, with all these I know only the 
Mantras and the sacred books, I do not know the Self.” 5 
The Mundaka Upanisad says : “ Two kinds of knowledge 
must be known, the higher and the lower. The lower 
knowledge is that which the Rg, Sama, Atharva Veda, 
Ceremonial, Grammar give . . . but the higher knowledge is 
that by which the indestructible Brahman is apprehended.” 6

The Problems Discussed in the Upanisads 

The central theme of the Upanisads is the problem 
of philosophy. It is the search for what is true. Dis- 
satisfaction with things and second causes suggests the 
questions, which we read at the beginning of the Svetas- 
vatara : “ Whence are we born, where do we live, and 

whither do we go ? 0, ye who know Brahman, tell us 

at whose command we abide here whether in pain or in 
pleasure. Should time or nature, or necessity or chance, 
or the elements be considered to be the cause, or he who 
is called Purusa, the man that is the Supreme spirit ? ” 
In the Kena Upanisad the pupil asks, “ At whose wish 
does the mind sent forth proceed on its errand ? At whose 
command does the first breath go forth, at whose wish do 
we utter this speech ? What god directs the eye or the 
ear ? ” 1 The thinkers did not take experience to be an 
inexplicable datum, as common sense does. They wondered 
whether the report of the senses could be taken as final. 
Are the mental faculties by which we acquire experience 
self-existent, or are they themselves effects of something 
mightier still, which lies behind them ? How can we 
consider physical objects, effects and products as they 
are, to be quite as real as their causes ? There must 
be something ultimate at the back of it all, a self- 
existent, in which alone the mind can rest. Knowledge, 
mind, the senses and their objects are all finite and con- 
ditioned. In the field of morals we find that we cannot 
get true happiness from the finite. The pleasures of the 
world are transient, being cut off by old age and death. 
Only the infinite gives durable happiness. In religion we 
cry for eternal life. All these force upon us the conviction 
of a timeless being, a spiritual reality, the object of philo- 
sophical quest, the fulfilment of our desires, and the goal 
of religion. The seers of the Upanisads try to lead us to 
this central reality which is infinite existence (sat), absolute 
truth (cit), and pure delight (ananda). The prayer of 

5 i. i.

every human heart is “ Lead me from the unreal to the 
real, lead me from darkness to light, lead me from death 
to immortality.” 1 

We shall deal with the philosophy of the Upanisads 
under the two heads of metaphysics and ethics. We shall 
present their views of ultimate reality, the nature of the 
world, and the problem of creation under metaphysics, 
and their analysis of the individual, his destiny, his ideal, 
the relation of karma to freedom, the highest conception 
of mukti or release, and the doctrine of rebirth under ethics. 


VII 

The Nature of Reality 

In solving the question of the nature of ultimate reality, 
the Upanisad thinkers seek to supplement the objective 
vision of the Vedic seers by a subjective one. The highest 
conception reached in the Vedic hymns was that of the one 
.reality (Ekam Sat), which realises itself in all the variety 
of existence. This conclusion is strengthened in the 
Upanisads, where the problem is sometimes approached by 
way of a philosophical analysis of the nature of the self 
which they call the Atman. The etymology of this word 
is obscure. In the Rg-Veda x. 16. 3 it means breath or 
the vital essence. Gradually it acquired the meaning of 
soul or self. The theory of the true self or Atman is not 
set out with any clearness or fullness of detail, nor are 
isolated statements connected into a coherent system. In 
a dialogue between the teacher Prajapati and the pupil 
Indra, narrated in the Chandogya Upanisad, 2 we find a 
progressive development in the definition of self through 
the four stages of (1) the bodily self, (2) the empirical self, 
(3) the transcendental self, and (4) the absolute self. The 
question discussed is not so much psychological as meta- 
physical. What is the nature of the self of man, his central 
being? Prajapati opens the discussion by giving certain

gamaya. Brh. Up., i. 3. 27. 



152 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

general characteristics which the true self should possess. 
“ The self which is free from sin, free from old age, from 
death and grief, from hunger and thirst, which desires 
nothing but what it ought to desire and imagines nothing 
but what it ought to imagine, that it is which we must try 
to understand.” 1 It is the subject which persists through- 
out the changes, the common factor in the states of waking, 
dream, sleep, death, rebirth and final deliverance.* It is 
the simple truth that nothing can destroy. Death does 
not touch it nor vice dissolve it. Permanence, continuity, 
unity, eternal activity are its characteristics. It is a world 
self-complete. There is nothing outside of it to set against 
it. Modern criticism will object to the whole procedure as 
a case of petitio principii. By the characteristics of self- 
containedness and self-completeness being assumed, the 
solution is taken for granted. But as we shall see, this 
line of procedure has its own meaning. Prajapati makes 
it clear that the self of man consists in the truly subjective, 
which can never become an object. It is the person that 
sees, not the object seen.3 It is not the bundle of qualities 
called the “ me,” but the I which remains beyond and behind 
inspecting all these qualities. It is the subject in the truest 
sense, and it can never become the object. Much of the con- 
tent of the self as ordinarily used can become an object. The 
argument assumes that whatever becomes an object belongs 
to the not-self. We must strip away everything of our 
actual self alien to or different from the self. The first 
answer given is that the body which is born, grows up and 
decays and dies, is the true self. The self, according to 
Prajapati, is indeed he who is seen when you look into 
another’s eye or a pail of water or a mirror. It is suggested 
that we observe a picture even to the very hairs and nails. 
To indicate that it is not the self, Prajapati asks Indra 
to adorn himself, put on the best clothes and look again 
into the water and the mirror, and he sees his likeness 
well adorned with best clothes and clean. A doubt occurs 
to Indra. “ As this self in the shadow or the water is well 
adorned when the body is well adorned, well dressed 
when the body is well dressed, well cleaned when the body 
* viii. 7. 1. * See Byb. Up., iv. 4. 3. < viii. 7. 3. 



PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 153 


is well cleaned, that self will also be blind if the body 
is blind, lame if the body is lame, crippled if the body is 
crippled, and perish, in fact, as soon as the body perishes. 
I see no good in this.” 1 Indra approaches his teacher 
Prajapati, and after another long interval is told that 
“ he who moves about happy in dreams is the self.” The 
true self is not the body which is exposed to all suffering 
and imperfections, which is a material phenomenon. The 
body is only an instrument used by consciousness, while 
consciousness is not the product of the body. And now 
Indra is told that the dreaming subject is the self, but he 
feels another difficulty. “ Though it is true that that self 
is not rendered faulty by faults of body, nor struck when 
it is struck, nor lamed when it is lamed, yet it is as if they 
struck him in dreams, as if they chased him. He becomes 
even conscious as it were of pain and sheds tears, therefore 
I see no good in this.”* Prajapati took the dream states 
instead of other mental experiences, because dreams being 
more independent of body are crucial in their nature. The 
self is supposed to roam untrammelled in dreams. In 
them the mind is said to float free of the accidents of body. 
This view equates the self with the ever-growing and changing 
mental experiences. This is the empirical self, and Indra 
rightly recognises that this empirical self is subject to the 
accidents of experience. It cannot be the subject, for every 
moment it is changing. Though it is independent of body, 
dream states do not seem to be self-existent, which the 
true self or Atman must be. The ego dependent on the 
limitations of time and birth cannot be said to be eternal. 
The self tethered to a local and temporal environment is 
a creature of time. It is the wanderer in the world of 
samsara. It constructs for itself an imperfect world out 
of imperfect data. It is not indestructible, nor has it 
boundless freedom. We seem to require a subject as the 
ground and sustainer of all experience, a vaster reality of 
which the dream states as well as waking experience are 
only imperfect revelations. A mere flux of states cannot 
be sustained by itself. The empirical self is not eternal 
in its own right. Indra again approaches Prajapati, explains 

* v:h ■, x. * v :i 10. a. ^ 



154

to him his position, and after a long time is taught. *' When 
a man being asleep, reposing and at perfect rest, sees no 
dreams, that is the self.” 1 Prajapati understands Indra’ s 
difficulty. The self could not be reduced to a series of 
states, for that would be to explain away the reality of a 
permanent ego, and make Atman subject to the vicissitudes 
of our chance experiences. Indra has to be taught that 
the objects of experience require a permanent subject by 
which they could be experienced. Prajapati intended to 
bring out how, while a grin required a cat, everywhere 
except in Alice’s wonderland, a cat need not always have 
a grin. The object depends upon the subject, but not the 
subject on the object in the same sense. Without the self 
there can be no knowledge, no art, no morality. Objects 
out of relation to a self are non-existent. From the subject 
are all objects and the subject itself is not a thing among 
other things. To enable Indra to realise that the self is 
the subject of all experiences, Prajapati employs the method 
of abstraction which has its own disadvantages. Our life 
is ordinarily busy with things. The world is too much 
with us. Our self is lost in feelings, desires and imaginations, 
and does not know what it really is. Leading the life of 
mere objectivity, absorbed in the things of nature, ever 
busy with the active pursuits of the world, we do not want 
to waste a moment’s thought on the first principle of all 
things — the self of man. Knowledge is taken for granted. 
To reflect on it, to understand its implications, means mental 
strain. In the history of European thought the question 
of the possibility of knowledge is a late one, but when it 
was put, it was realised that knowledge was impossible 
without what Kant called the transcendental unity of 
apperception, what Plotinus referred to as the “ accom- 
paniment " by the soul of its own mental activities. The 
most elementary presentation requires the reality of self. 
In the most apparently passive perceptions we realise the 
activity of the self. All changes, all experiences, assume 
a central self. The changes themselves are recog 
nised as changes wdthin a whole, which we are trying to 
actualise. Prajapati wishes to bring out the necessity 

1 viii. ii. i. 



PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 155 


of this self by urging that the self continuously exists, 
even when the waking or the dreaming experience is sus- 
pended. In sleep, deep and dreamless, we have no felt 
objects of experience, but we cannot on that account say 
there is no self. Prajapati assumes that Indra will admit 
the reality of a self in sleep, for the continuity of conscious- 
ness, despite the temporal gaps, cannot otherwise be accounted 
for. Devadatta, after good sleep, continues to be Devadatta, 
since his experiences unite themselves to the system which 
existed at the time when he went to sleep. They link 
themselves to his thoughts and do not fly to any other’s. 
This continuity of experience requires us to admit a perma- 
nent self underlying all contents of consciousness. That 
which exists in sleep without any objects to contemplate 
is the self. The mirror is not shattered simply because 
nothing is seen in it. Prajapati tries to bring out the 
absolute supremacy of the subject over the object, the 
truth of Yajnavalkya’s statement that even when all objects 
are extinguished, the subject persists in its own light. 
“ When the sun has set, when the moon has set, and when the 
fire is put out, the self alone is his light.” 1 But Indra was 
too much of a psychologist for Prajapati. He felt 
that this self, freed from all bodily experience, from 
the shapeless mass of dreams, etc., this objectless self, 
is a barren fiction. If the self is not what it knows, feels 
and reacts upon, if it is divorced from it and thus emptied 
of its content, what remains ? “ Nothing,” said Indra. 

" To be free from everything is to be nothing.” 2 Gautama, 
the Buddha, takes up the analogy of a tree and asks what 
is that tree which is supposed to remain, after we tear away 
its leaves, hew down its branches, strip off its bark, etc. ? 
Peel off layer after layer of an onion, and what remains ? 
Nothing. Bradley points out : " The ego that pretends to 
be anything either before or beyond its concrete psychical 
filling is a gross fiction and a mere monster, and for no 
purpose admissible. ” 3 On this view in dreamless sleep 
there is no self at all. Locke declares that every drowsy

nod explodes the self theory. " In sleep and trances the 
mind exists not — there is no time, no succession of ideas. 
To say the mind exists without thinking is a contradiction, 
nonsense, nothing.” 1 Indra seems to have been an em- 
piricist ages before Locke and Berkeley. “ If the soul in 
a perfectly dreamless sleep thinks, feels, and wills nothing, 
is the soul then at all, and if it is, how is it ? ” asks Lotze. 
“ How often has the answer been given, that if this could 
happen, the soul would have no being. Why have we not 
the courage to say that as often as this happens the soul 
is not ? ” 1 Indra has the courage to declare it. 3 “ It is 
indeed destroyed.” This has an important lesson which is 
again and again forgotten in Indian thought. To deny 
the life without is to destroy the god within. Those who 
think that we reach the highest point attainable, in pure 
subj ectivity must turn to the dialogue of Indra and Praj apati. 
The condition freed from the limits imposed by the organism, 
from time and space, from the existence of objects, is simple 
annihilation, according to Indra. This contentless ego, this 
abstract cogito of Descartes, this formal unity of Kant, 
this objectless subject supposed to stand behind, unrelated 
to all empirical consciousness, is an impossibility. Philo- 
sophical reflection as well as psychological analysis leads 
to this result. But Prajapati was trying to emphasise the 
identity of the self which is unaffected by the changes of 
experience. He was anxious to point out that while the 
self was not exclusive of conscious states, it was not the 
conscious states. Dr. McTaggart puts the whole point thus : 
” What does the self include ? Everything of which it is 
conscious. What does it exclude ? Equally-Everything of 
which it is conscious. What can it say is not inside it ? 
Nothing What can it say is not outside it ? A single 
abstraction. And any attempt to remove the paradox 
destroys the self. For the two sides are inevitably con- 
nected. If we try to make it a distinct individual by 
separating it from all other things, it loses all content, of 
which it can be conscious, and so loses the very individuality

1 Vinasamevapito bhavati, Chan. Up., viii. 11. 1—2, 



PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 157 


which we started by trying to preserve. If, on the other 
hand, we try to save its content, by emphasising the inclusion 
at the expense of the exclusion, then the consciousness 
vanishes ; and since the self has no contents, but the obj ects 
of which it is conscious, the contents vanish also.” 1 Indra 
shows the risks in conceiving the self as a transcendental 
one. The self must be shown to be the true life of the 
whole, and not a mere abstraction. Hence the next step, 
when Indra explains to Prajapati his difficulty in the words, 
" in truth that dreamless sleeping subject does not know 
himself that he is, nor does he know anything that exists. 
He is gone to utter annihilation, I see no good in this.” 1 
Prajapati points out how it is an identity, running in and 
through differences. The whole world is the one process 
of the self-realisation of the absolute thought. “ Magha- 
van ! 3 This body is mortal and all is subject to death. 
It is the abode of the self, which is immortal and without 
body. He is the person of the eye, the eye itself is the 
instrument of seeing. He who knows, let me smell this, 
he is the self, the nose is the instrument of smelling, etc.” 4 
The self is shown to be not an abstract formal principle, 
but an active universal consciousness, existing, to adopt 
Hegel’s phraseology, both in itself and for itself. It is 
simple self-sameness as well as varied distinctions. It is 
both subject and object. The objects we know in experi- 
ence are based on it. The true infinite self is not the self 
which is simply not finite. It is none of the limited things, 
but yet the basis of all of them. It is the universal self, 
which is immanent as well as transcendent. The whole 
universe lives and breathes in it. “ The moon and the 
sun are its eyes, the four quarters of the sky its ears, the 
wind its breath. ”5 It is the blazing light that burns in

immortal and the other mortal. The mortal soul consists of passions and

world of change and death. The immortal soul is the intelligent principle 
common to man and the world, the divine spark enclosed in human person- 
ality ( Timceus and Phcedo). We have also the same distinction in Aristotle’s 
intellects agens as opposed to perishing mind and memory.

the deeps of personality, the universal akasa from which 
all creatures proceed, 1 the vital principle of creation, 2 the 
subject in which the entire world moves trembling.3 There 
is nothing outside it. It contains all consciousness of objects 
implicitly. There is nothing in the universe which is not 
involved in the infinite self in us. This self which embraces 
all is the sole reality containing within itself all the facts 
of nature and all the histories of experience. Our small 
selves are included in it and transcended by it. This is 
the subject which is more than the flux of presentations, 
which are only imperfect revelations of it. All our states 
of consciousness revolve round this central light. Abolish 
it, they vanish. Without a subject there will be no flux, 
no order of sensations in space or sequences in time. It 
renders possible memory and introspection, knowledge and 
morality. The Upanisads contend that this subject is the 
universal ground which is in all individuals. It is hidden 
in all things and pervades all creation. “ There is no second 
outside it, no other distinct term.” 4 “ As breathing he is 
named breath, as speaking speech, as seeing eye, as hearing 
ear, as understanding mind, all these are but names for 
his operations.” 5 It is only the self thus understood that 
can be looked upon as the permanent subject persisting 
in waking and dreaming, death and sleep, bondage and 
liberation. It is present throughout, surveying all the 
worlds. It is the universal subject and yet the universal 
object. It sees and yet sees not. As the Upanisad has it, 
“ When then he sees not, yet is he seeing, although he sees 
not ; since for the seer there is no interruption of seeing 
because he is imperishable ; but there is no second beside 
him, no other distinct from him, for him to see.” 6 The 
self is the whole. “I indeed am this whole universe.” 7 
This universal self by its very nature cannot be per- 
ceived. As Samkara puts it, " The witness self illumines 
consciousness, but never itself is in consciousness.” It is 
not a datum of experience, not an object, though all objects

are for it. It is not a thought, but all thoughts are for it. 
It is not a thing seen, but is the principle of all seeing. As 
Kant would say, the condition of the empirically known 
is not the known itself. “ What I must presuppose in order 
to know an object,” says Kant, “ I cannot know as an 
object.” The subject of all experience cannot itself be an 
experience. If it is experience, the question arises, by 
whom is it known ? Knowledge always works dually. 
This self, therefore, is indefinable. Like all ultimate prin- 
ciples, it has only to be accepted. It is the explanation 
of all else, though it itself remains unexplained. The old 
difficulty of Comte that the subject cannot turn round 
and catch itself is not altogether imaginary. “ The soul 
which is not this or that, nor aught else, is intangible, for 
it cannot be laid hold of.” 1 The Upanisads refuse to identify 
the self with the body, or the series of mental states or the 
presentation continuum or the stream of consciousness. 
The self cannot be a relation which requires a ground of 
relations, nor a connexion of contents, which is unintelligible 
without an agent who connects. We are obliged to accept the 
reality of a universal consciousness which ever accompanies 
the contents of consciousness and persists even when there 
are no contents. This fundamental identity, which is the 
presupposition of both self and not-self, is called the Atman. 
None can doubt its reality. 1 

The Mandukya Upanisad gives us an analysis of con- 
sciousness leading to the same conclusion. We shall start 
with a free rendering of what it says on this point. 3 The 
soul has three conditions which are all included in a fourth. 
They are waking, dreaming, sleeping, and what is called 
turiya. The first condition is that of wakefulness, where the 
self is conscious of the common world of external objects. It 
enjoys the gross things. Here the dependence on the body 
is predominant. The second condition is that of dreaming, 
where the self enjoys subtle things/ fashions for itself a 
new world of forms with the materials of its waking ex- 
perience. The spirit is said to roam freely unfettered by

the bonds of the body. The third is the condition of sound 
sleep, where we have neither dreams nor desires. It is 
called susupti. The soul is said to become temporarily 
one with Brahman and enjoy bliss. In deep sleep we are 
lifted above all desires and freed from the vexations of 
spirit. The oppositions are, so to say, lost in this pure- 
objectless-knowing subject condition. 1 Samkara observes 
that the phenomena of duality caused by the action of the 
mind are present in the other two conditions, but absent 
here. In several passages we are told that we taste the 
nature of absolute bliss in dreamless sleep, where a man 
is cut off from the distracting world. The soul is divine 
in origin, though clogged with the flesh. In sleep it is said 
to be released from the shackles of the body and to gain 
back its own nature. We read in an Aristotelian fragment, 
“ whenever the soul is alone and by itself in sleep, it recovers 
by its proper nature.” 2 The natural divinity of the soul 
reasserts itself when freed from the tyranny of the flesh. 
“ He giveth his beloved truth in sleep.” The analogy of 
eternal dreamless sleep is used to bring out how all outer 
activities are then suppressed. But there was the likelihood 
of its being confused with sheer unconsciousness. So the 
Mandukya Upanisad points out that the highest is not 
this dreamless sleep, but another, a fourth state of the soul, 
a pure intuitional consciousness, where there is no knowledge 
of objects internal or external. In deep sleep the spirit 
dwells in a region far above the changeful life of sense in 
absolute union with Brahman. The turiya condition brings 
out the positive aspect of the negative emphasised in the 
condition of deep sleep. “ The fourth is not that which is 
conscious of the subjective, nor that which is conscious of 
the objective, nor that which is conscious of both, nor 
that which is simple consciousness, nor that which is an 
all-sentient mass, nor that which is all darkness. It is 
unseen, transcendent, inapprehensible, uninferrable, un- 
thinkable, indescribable, the sole essence of the conscious- 
ness of self, the completion of the world, the ever peace- 
ful, all blissful, the one unit, this indeed is the Atman.” 3

It is symbolised by the Aumkara, with its parts of A-U-M, 
the waking, the dreaming and the sleeping states. It is 
not an exclusive self, but the common ground of all, their 
basis of identity. 1 In deep sleep we may be said to reach 
an eternal unity in which all distinctions vanish and the 
entire universe is obliterated. But since this cannot be 
considered the highest state, a higher positive is suggested. 
To the empirical individual, if the not-self goes, his indi- 
viduality also vanishes. So there is a suspicion that the 
abolition of the objects would reduce the self into a thin 
abstraction, but in the highest universal self the reality of 
all objects is included. Objects of the world are known 
and loved by us only in so far as they enter our self, which 
comprehends in itself all objects of the universe and has 
nothing outside. It is the unchanged and persistent identity 
which continues in the midst of all change. The moods 
pass and vary but the self remains the same. It has no 
beginning, no end, though the objects of which it is conscious 
have a beginning and an end. “ Never has the cessation 
of consciousness been experienced, or witnessed directly ; 
or if it has been, then the witness, the experiencer, himself 
still remains behind as the continued embodiment of that 
same consciousness.” 2 It is the foundation of all existence, 
the one witness to and the only possible support of all we 
know, though the nature of the dependence of the objects 
of knowledge on the subject so insistently repeated is not 
very clear. The three conditions of the self, waking, dream- 
ing, sleeping, together with that which comprehends them 
all, are called respectively the Visva, the Taijasa, the Prajna 
and the Turiya states.3 

From this analysis of the three states of dreaming, 
waking and sleeping, it follows that all of them are unreal, 
though not non-existent. “ What is naught at the beginning 
and naught at the end must surely be naught in the middle.” 4 
Judged by it, waking experience is not real. If it is said

that the dream states are unreal since they do not cohere 
with the rest of our experience, may it not be urged that 
the waking experience does not cohere with dreams ? 
Dreams may be coherent within themselves, even as waking 
experience is within its own bounds. The worlds seem to 
be real only in relation to the particular moods of the self. 
It is not right to apply the standard of waking experience 
to the dream world and condemn it. Dreaming and waking 
experiences are both unreal though in different degrees. 
The condition of dreamless sleep is one in which we have 
no distinct cognitions of anything internal or external. It 
is a distinctionless mass under the pall of darkness, com- 
parable to Hegel’s night, in which all cows are black. We 
have here the negative condition of the highest state, freedom 
from sorrow. But Atman is not this absence of unhappiness. 
It is positive bliss. It is neither waking nor dreaming nor 
sleep, but the fourth witnessing to as well as transcending 
the three. The negative descriptions given indicate that 
we as finite cannot know the positive nature of it. The 
fourth is realised, not so much by negating the three as by 
transcending them all. It is impossible for us finite beings 
to define the character of the ideal reality, though the 
Upanisads are quite emphatic that it is not a blank. Yet 
to refute false ideas of the highest and to point the truth 
that it is no abstraction, they indulge in inadequate con- 
cepts. Strictly speaking we cannot say anything of it. 
Yet for purposes of discussion, we are obliged to use intel- 
lectual concepts with their limited validity. 

The problem of the self is one of the most important 
discussed in the Upanisads. It occurs again as the 
Adhyatma Vidya in the Bhagavadgita and the Vedanta 
Sutras. The analysis of the nature of self is the legacy of 
the Upanisads bequeathed to the subsequent systems of 
thought. It has given rise to many misconceptions. Con- 
tradictory doctrines of the nature of self are held by Buddha 
and Samkara, Kapila and Patanjali, whose views can be traced 
to the Upanisads. It was not the intention of the Upani- 
sads to make of the deeper self an abstract nothingness. It 
is the fullest reality, the completest consciousness, and not a 
mere negative calm, untroubled by any unrest and unpolluted 



PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 163 


by any blot or blemish. The logic of thought has in it 
a negative movement, where it rises by the repudiation of 
the finite, but this is only a stage in the onward march. 
By the negative process the self has to recognise that its 
essence is not in its finitude or self-sufficiency. By the 
positive method it finds its true self in the life and being of 
all. All things exist within this true self. Some Buddhists 
make of the self mere emptiness, and on this assumption 
rightly dismiss it as an abstraction of the metaphysician. 
We cannot find this self in any corner of the field of con- 
sciousness. Not finding it there, we rush to the conclusion 
that it is nothing. The Samkhya takes it to be a simple 
and pure, though passive, spirit, which in spite of its apparent 
simplicity has some character and uniqueness, and so we 
get the doctrine of the boundless plurality of souls. Some 
Vedantins adopt the view that the true self or Brahman 
is pure, calm, peaceful and untroubled, and hold that there 
is only one self. By throwing the emphasis on the passive 
side they run the risk of reducing it to mere emptiness. 
There are Buddhistic sects which reduce the self to mere 
intelligence, which can somehow think without any contents.

Brahman 

We may now proceed to define the ultimate reality from 
the objective side, when it is called Brahman 1 . In the 

1 The question how Brahman came to denote the supreme reality of the 
Upanisads has been answered in diSerent ways by different scholars. 
Haug holds that Brahman means prayer, being derived from the root 
Brh, to swell or to grow. It is that which swells or grows. Sacred 
prayers cause the growth, and then it came to mean the force of nature, and 
later the supreme reality. According to Roth, Brahman is first the force 
of will directed to the gods, then it came to mean a sacred formula, and then 
the Absolute. Oldenberg thinks that in the Vedic times, when the world 
was peopled with many gods and mysterious forces capable of producing 
happiness and misery, the most powerful man was the medicine man, who 
wielded the magic spell and produced whatever effect was desired. Then 
Brahman meant a magic spell. During the time of the Brahmanas it 
referred to the sacred hymns used in the sacrifices. Perhaps some of these 
hymns were used as spells for producing magical effects. The word was 
slowly transferred to the central energy which produces the world. Deussen

Rg-Veda we have seen that the monistic idea was arrived 
at. The Upanisads undertake the task of a more logical 
definition of the Eternal Spirit ever acting and ever resting. 
In another place we have traced the progress from the 
lower imperfect conceptions to the more adequate anes 
as formulated in the Taittiriya Upanisad. 1 In chapter iii 
the son approaches the father with the request to teach 
him the nature of reality from which all things flow 
and to which all return. The son is given the general 
features of Brahman, and is asked to discover the content 
which satisfies these requirements. “ That from which these 
beings are born, that in which when born they live, and that 
into which they enter at their death, that is Brahman.” 3 
Things of the world are ever changing their forms, and 
they cannot be considered to be real in an ultimate 
sense. Is there anything unalterably fixed underlying the 
universe of changing things, namarupa, name and form, as 
the Upanisads call them ? The son considers matter to 
be the ultimate reality. It is the most prominent aspect 
of the outer world. This view is held by the lokayatas, or 
the materialists. The son soon discovers that matter cannot 
account for the life phenomena. Vegetable growth requires 
a different explanation. He hits upon prana or life as 
the ultimate principle. 3 Matter does not hold the secret 
of life, though life cannot exist without matter. There is 
something in life which enables it to absorb and transmute 
the inorganic elements. This something is the vital principle 
which in man helps to change the vegetable product into 
blood, bone and muscle. It is the principle which pervades 
the universe and binds human beings with the rest of 
creation. 4 The son is sure that life belongs to a different 
order from matter though prana is the essence of the body. 5 


holds that Brahman is prayer, which elevates the soul, when we perceive the 
truth, and the truth came to be denoted by the word. Max Muller traces 
it to “word,” as is evident from the name Brhaspati or Vacaspati, lord 
of speech. That which utters is Brahman (S.S., pp. 52, 70). We need not 
trouble ourselves about the etymology of the word. To us, it is clear. Brahman 
means reality, which grows, breathes or swells.

Again he is dissatisfied with the solution of prana as the 
ultimate reality, for conscious phenomena which we come 
across in the animal world are not explicable by the prin- 
ciple of life. Manas, or perceptual consciousness, is a pro- 
duct distinct from life and matter. It seems to be the 
crown of the vital process. So the son believes that manas 
is Brahman. Even this will not suffice, for there are intel- 
lectual facts which mere perceptual consciousness does 
not take into account. Vijnana or intelligence is Brahman. 1 
Some schools of Buddhism adopt this view. The son realises 
that even intellectual self-consciousness is incomplete, 
being subject to discord and imperfection. It is the aim 
of the Upanisads to point out that elements of duality 
and externality persist at the intellectual level, however 
much we may try to overcome them. In knowledge and 
morality we have the subject-object relation. There must 
be something higher than mere intellect, where existence is 
no longer formulated in terms of knowledge. The unity of 
existence requires that we must transcend the intellectual 
level. Thought, as ordinarily understood, deals with objects 
viewed as beyond or other than the process of thinking. It 
reaches outwards to a somewhat other than and contrasted 
with itself. Reality is different from thought, and can 
be reached in the turiya state of highest immediacy, which 
transcends thought and its distinctions, where the individual 
coincides with the central reality. Ananda or delight is 
the highest fruition, where the knower, the known and 
the knowledge become one. Here the philosophical quest 
terminates, the suggestion being that there is nothing 
higher than ananda. This ananda is active enjoyment 
or unimpeded exercise of capacity. It is not sinking 
into nothingness, but the perfection of being. 1 “ The 
discerning see by their superior knowledge the Atman 
which shines all bliss and immortality.” 3 Strictly speaking, 
we cannot give any account of the highest reality of ananda. 
Even thi question whether it is abstract or concrete is 
illogical. Intellectual necessities require us to give some 
description. It is truer to consider it concrete than abstract.

166 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

Each higher principle is more concrete and inclusive than 
the lower one, and therefore ananda, which is Brahman, 
is the most inclusive of all. From it all things flow. By 
it all things are sustained, and into it all things are dis- 
solved. The different parts, the mineral world, the plant 
life, the animal kingdom, and the human society, are not 
related to the highest in any abstract or mechanical way. 
They are one in and through that which is universal about 
them. All parts in the universe share in the light of this 
universal spirit and possess specific features on account 
of the special functions which they have to perform. The 
parts are not self-subsistent factors, but are dependent 
aspects of the one. “ Sir, on what does the infinite rest ? 
On its own greatness or not even on greatness.” Every- 
thing else hangs on it and it hangs on nothing. The organic 
and living nature of the relation of the parts to the whole 
is brought out in many passages. " As all spokes are con- 
tained in the axle, and in the felly of a wheel, thus also, 
all beings and all gods, all worlds and all organs, also are 
contained in that self .” 1 " There is that ancient tree 
whose roots grow upward and whose branches go downward. 
That is the bright. Brahman, the immortal, all worlds are 
contained in it and no one goes beyond it.” 1 

We have defined reality as ananda, and thus contra- 
dicted the statement frequently made that the ultimate 
is indefinable. Constructive attempts at obtaining a com- 
prehensive reality generally end in a concrete whole. If, 
however, we try to reconcile the defined reality with the 
undefined one, which also the Upanisads support, then 
we shall have to say that ananda in the present context 
is not the ultimate reality, but only the highest conceivable 
by the thought of man. It is not the absolute or the eternal 
being which ever exists in its own essentiality. To the 
logical mind, the whole is real, and within it falls the diversity 
of the world. The concrete ananda is the pramanika 
satta, or the real revealed to thought, and answers to 
the highest Brahman accepted by Ramanuja. The pure 
Brahman free from all the predicates is the nirupadhika

PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 167 


satta, or the Nirguna Brahman accepted by Samkara. The 
former is an organised whole ; the latter is an indefinable 
real. Yet even according to Samkara it is the latter that 
shows itself as the former. The one of intuition appears 
as the whole of knowledge. 1 * 

This difference of view has resulted in a good deal of 
discussion about the interpretation of ananda in the 
Upanisads. Samkara squarely says that anandamaya, by 
its suffix maya, indicates that it is only a phenomenal effect. 
Unless it were different from Atman, there can be no talk 
of reasoning about it. If it were pure Brahman, it will 
be inappropriate to give it form and attribute to it head, 
limbs, as the Taittiriya Upanisad does. If ananda were 
Brahman there would be no separate mention of Brahman 
as the supporting tail of ananda. 3 So fsamkara concludes, 
" Anandamaya Atman is an effect, and not the uncon- 
ditioned Atman.” Ramanuja, on the other hand, argues that 
this ananda is Brahman. The suffix of maya indicates 
only fullness or pracurya. Though with regard to matter, 
life, etc., it is clearly stated that there is some other inside, 
anyo 'ntara Atma, no such inner reality is asserted for ananda. 
Ascribing limbs, etc., is nothing more than kalpana or im- 
agination. Puccham Brahma need not be taken as implying 
any difference between ananda and Brahman. The two 
may be related as whole and part,3 which is sometimes the 
significance of the accusative usage. Immediately after the 
reference to anandamaya, it is said in the Upanisad 
“ sokamayata,” “ he desired,” and this masculine gender 
can only refer to anandamaya, and not to puccham Brahma, 


1 The Upanisads are definite about the fact that the supreme is in- 
definable, though they give intellectual accounts of it which are not abso- 
lutely true. If any logical description be true at all, it is Ramanuja’s way 
of putting it, Sariikara, in the true spirit of the Upanisads, contends that 
there is a higher than the logical highest, which is Ramanuja’s. In discussing 
the philosophy of Sarhkara, we shall see how he establishes the inadequacy 
of the highest categories to the reality intended by them. He contends 

that we cannot say whether the absolute is finite or infinite, or both or neither. 
It is the same with all relations like whole and part, substance and quality, 
cause and effect. A rational demonstration of the limits of thought such 
as the one we have in Sarhkara is rendered possible only by the intervening 
of the great Buddhist tradition between the Upanisads and 6amkara.

168 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

which is neuter. Other forms of bliss, like priya, moda, 
are included within the whole of ananda, and the disciple 
reaches his final resting-place when he gets to ananda. 
We have many cases in the same Upanisad where the 
word ananda is used as a synonym for final reality. 

It is obvious that the whole controversy is due to the 
doubt whether ananda is to be looked upon as the logical 
highest or the ultimate being. The Upanisads did not 
draw any hard and fast line of distinction between the 
simple one of intuition supported by Saihkara and the 
concrete whole of Ramanuja. If we separate the two, 
it will become impossible for us to admit any distinction 
or value in the world of concrete existence. The Upanisads 
imply that the Isvara is practically one with Brahman. 
Very strict usage and meticulous philosophic accuracy 
require us to say that there is the slightest conceivable 
diminution from the absolute when we come to the self- 
conscious, I am I. 1 This quasinought is quite enough for 
Sarhkara to precipitate pure being, the basal thought and fact 
of all, into the world of space, time and cause. The Upanisads 
by implication admit that the moment we think the pure 
being, we make nothing the principle of distinction and 
difference, equally basal. The self-conscious God, who later 
develops into the organised whole of existence, is the maxi- 
mum of being and the minimum of non-being. He is least 
penetrated with objectivity and touched by externality. 
The One is revealed in the existences of the world, and that is 
why we are able to ascertain the degrees of reality possessed 
by the objects of the world by measuring the distance 
separating them from the One. Each lower degree con- 
sists in a diminution of the higher, though throughout 
the scale of existences from the highest to the lowest we 
have the revelation of Brahman as well as the common 
characters of space, time and cause. The lower things are 
far away from the simple being than the higher ones, so 
much so that the anandamaya of the Upanisads, the 
concrete Brahman of Ramanuja, the Isvara of Saihkara, 
is the nearest to it. Nothing nearer can be thought. The 
supreme Brahman or ananda at the level of vijnana or

self-consciousness becomes the personal Isvara with a 
voluntary limitation. God or self is the ground of unity, 
and matter or not-self becomes the principle of plurality. 1 


IX 

Brahman and Atman 

The two, the objective and the subjective, the Brahman 
and the Atman, the cosmic and the psychical principles, are 
looked upon as identical. Brahman is Atman. 3 “ He who 
is this Brahman in man, and who is that in the sun, those 
are one.” 3 The transcendent conception of God held in 
the Rg-Veda is here transformed into an immanent one. 
The infinite is not beyond the finite but in the finite. The 
subjective character of the Upanisad teaching is responsible 
for this change. The identity between the subject and 
the object was realised in India before Plato was born. 
Deussen speaks of it thus : “ If we strip this thought of 
the various forms, figurative to the highest degree and not 
seldom extravagant, under which it appears in the Vedanta 
texts, and fix our attention upon it solely in its philosophical 
simplicity as the identity of God and the soul, the Brahman 
and the Atman, it will be found to possess a significance 
reaching far beyond the Upanisads, their time and country ; 
nay, we claim for it an inestimable value for the whole 
race of mankind. We are unable to look into the future, 
we do not know what revelations and discoveries are in 
store for the restlessly inquiring human spirit ; but one 
thing we may assert with confidence — whatever new and 
unwonted paths the philosophy of the future may strike 
out, this principle will remain permanently unshaken, and 
from it no deviation can possibly take place. If ever a 
general solution is reached of the great riddle, which presents 
itself to the philosopher in the nature of things, all the more 
clearly the further our knowledge extends, the key can 
only be found where alone the secret of nature lies open

to us from within, that is to say, in our innermost self. It 
was here that for the first time the original thinkers of the 
Upanisads, to their immortal honour, found it when they 
recognised our Atman, our inmost individual being, as the 
Brahman, the inmost being of universal nature and of all 
her phenomena.” 1 This identity of subject and object is 
not a vague hypothesis, but the necessary implication of 
all relevant thinking, feeling and willing. The human self 
cannot think, conquer and love nature, were it unthinkable, 
unconquerable and unlovable. Nature is the object of 
a subject, quite rational and thoroughly intelligible, capable 
of control and worthy of love. It exists for man. The 
stars serve as lamps for his feet, and the darkness to lull 
him into slumber. Nature summons us to the spiritual 
reality of life and answers the needs of the soul. It is 
formed, vitalised and directed by the spirit. From the 
beginning of reflection this oneness of subject and object, 
the existence of one central reality, pervading and embracing 
all, has been the doctrine of the devout. Religious mysticism 
and deep piety witness to the truth of the great saying, 
" That art thou,” " Tat tvamasi.” We may not understand 
it, but that does not give us a sufficient right to deny it. 

The different conceptions of Brahman correspond to the 
different ideas of the Atman, and vice versa. The stages 
of waking, dreaming, sleeping, and the conception of ecstasy 
of the self, are clearly discriminated in the later Vedanta 
writings and answer to the different conceptions of Brahman. 
The highest Brahman which is ananda is just Atman, 
as realised in the fourth or the turiya state. There the 
object and the subject are one. The seer, the seeing eye 
and the object seen merge together in one whole. W'he” 
we identify the Atman with the self-conscious individual, 
Brahman is viewed as the self-conscious Isvara with a 
force opposed to him. As the self-conscious individual 
will be a mere abstraction apart from some content or 
object from which he derives his being, even so the Isvara 
requires an element opposing him. The conception of 
Isvara is the highest object of the religious consciousness.

self of man (manas and prana). Brahman is reduced to 
the Hiranyagarbha or the cosmic soul, which comes between 
the Isvara and the soul of man. This Hiranyagarbha is 
looked upon as related to the universe in the same way as 
the individual soul is related to its body. We see here 
the influence of the Rg-Veda. The world is supposed to 
have a consciousness and a will. Mind always goes with 
body, vaster orders of mind accompanying vaster orders 
of body. The world in which we live has its own mind, 
and this mind is Hiranyagarbha. This conception of world 
soul appears in the Upanisads under various names and 
forms. It is called Karya Brahma, or the effect God, the 
Brahma of Natura Naturata, as distinguished from the 
Karana Brahma or the Causal God of Isvara, or the natura 
naturans. This effect God is the totality of created exist- 
ences of which all finite objects are parts. The conscious 
totality of all effects is Brahma or Hiranyagarbha. It is 
not radically different from the Brahman. Brahman is 
the simple, individual, absolutely self-identical. One, 
without a second. Once He is looked at as the creator or 
Isvara, again as the Created or Hiranyagarbha. Even 
this Brahma comes from the Brahman 1 — “ He is the source 
of Brahma ” ; the entire objective universe is sustained 
by this knowing subject. While the individual subjects 
pass away, he lives contemplating the w’orld. When we 
identify the Atman with our body. Brahman becomes the 
Cosmos or the Virat. Virat is the all, the hypostasisation 
of the conception of the world as a whole. It is the totality 
of things, the sum of all existence. “ This is he, the internal 
Atman of all created things whose head is Agni, whose eyes 
are the sun and the moon, whose ears are the four directions, 
whose speech is the Vedas which have emanated from Him, 
whose breath is Vayu, whose heart is all the universe, and 
from whose feet the earth proceeded .” 2 The body of the 
Virat is made of the material objects in their aggregate. 
He is the manifested God whose senses are the directions, 
whose body is the five elements, and whose consciousness 
glows with the feeling “ I am all.” Prior to the evolution 
of the Virat must have occurred the evolution of the Sutrat-

man, the cosmic intelligence or Hiranyagarbha, having for his 
vehicle the totality of subtle bodies. Virat comes into being 
after Hiranyagarbha. In the form of Virat, Hiranyagarbha 
becomes visible. Till the effect is evolved, this Sutratman is 
consciousness associated with the subtle body (suksma sarira). 
He abides as a mere potentiality of intelligence and motion 
(Vijnana and Kriya) in the first cause. The Virat is the uni- 
versal self manifested in the gross physical matter of the world, 
Brahma is the same manifested in the subtle matter of the 
universe. The Sutratman is Hiranyagarbha, The supreme 
self beyond cause and effect is the Brahman, but when it 
becomes self-conscious with a non-ego opposed to it we have 
the Hvara. 1 * 3 4 The following table suggests the scheme: —

If a logical account is permitted, then we may say that 
the Brahman of the Upanisads is no metaphysical ab- 
straction, no indeterminate identity, no void of silence. 
It is the fullest and the most real being. It is a living 
dynamic spirit, the source and container of the infinitely 
varied forms of reality. The distinctions, instead of being 
dissolved away as illusory, are transfigured in the highest 
reality. The syllable “ aum,” generally employed to repre- 
sent the nature of Brahman, brings out its concrete character. 1 
It is the symbol of the supreme spirit, the “ emblem of the 
most high.” 3 “ Aum ” is the symbol of concreteness as well 

as completeness. It stands for the three principal qualities 
of the supreme spirit personified as Brahma, Visnu and 
Siva in later literature. “ A ” is Brahma the creator, “ U ” 
is Visnu the preserver, and “ M ” is Siva the destroyer.4

world suppressed, though not abolished.

PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 173 


The La Upanisad asks us to worship Brahman both in 
its manifested and unmanifested conditions. 1 It is not an 
abstract monism that the Upanisads offer us. There is 
difference but also identity. Brahman is infinite not in 
the sense that it excludes the finite, but in the sense that 
it is the ground of all finites. It is eternal not in the sense 
that it is something back beyond all time, as though there 
were two states temporal and eternal, one of which superseded 
the other, but that it is the timeless reality of all things in 
time. The absolute is neither the infinite nor the finite, 
the self or its realisation, the one life or its varied expressions, 
but is the real including and transcending the self and its 
realisation, life and its expression. It is the spiritual spring 
which breaks, blossoms and differentiates itself into number- 
less finite centres. The word Brahman means growth, and 
is suggestive of life, motion and progress, and not death, 
stillness or stagnation. The ultimate reality is described 
as sat, cit and ananda — existence, consciousness, and 
bliss. “ Knowledge, power and action are of its nature." 
It is self-caused. 2 Taittiriya says Brahman is existence, 
consciousness and infinity. It is a positive reality, “ Full 
is that, full is this.” 3 It is obvious that the ultimate 
reality is not thought, or force, or being exclusively, but 
the living unity of essence and existence, of the ideal and 
real, of knowledge, love and beauty. But as we have 
already said, it can only be described negatively by us, 
though it is not a negative indeterminate principle.

Intellect and Intuition 

The ideal of intellect is to discover the unity which 
comprehends both the subject and the object. That there 
is such a unity is the working principle of logic and life. To 
find out its contents is the aim of philosophic endeavour. 
But the enterprise is doomed to disappointment on account 
of the inherent incapacity of intellect to grasp the whole.

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


Intellect, with its symbols and shibboleths, creeds and con- 
ventions, is not by itself adequate to the grasp of the real, 
“ from which all speech with the mind turns away unable 
to reach it.” 1 * “ The eye does not go thither, nor speech 

nor mind. We do not know. We do not understand how 
any one can teach it.” 3 * * The ultimate reality cannot be 
made into an objective representation which the intellect 
can grasp. “ How should he know him by whom he 
knows all this ? How, 0 Beloved, should he know himself 
the knower.” 3 Objective knowledge of the subject is im- 
possible. It is “ unseen but seeing, unheard but hear- 
ing, unperceived but perceiving, unknown but knowing.” * 
Atman is not non-existent, simply because it cannot be 
objectively represented. Though man’s intellectual capacities 
are not adequate for its comprehension, still they will have 
no existence but for it. 5 “ That which one cannot think 
with the mind, but that by which they say the mind is 
made to think, know that alone to be the Brahman.” 6 
Intellect works with the categories of space, time, cause 
and force, which involve us in deadlocks and antinomies. 
Either we must postulate a first cause, in which case 
causality ceases to be a universal maxim, or we have an 
endless regress. The puzzle cannot be solved by intellect, 
pure and simple. It must confess itself to be bankrupt 
when ultimate questions arise. “ The gods are in Indra ; 
Indra is in the Father God, the Father God is in Brahma, 
but in what is Brahma? ” and Yajnavalkya answers: "Ask 
not too much.” 7 Our intellectual categories can give 
descriptions of the empirical universe under the forms of 
space, time and cause, but the real is beyond these. While 
containing space, it is not spatial ; while including time, 
it transcends time ; while it has a causally bound system 
of nature within it, it is not subject to the law of cause. 
The self-existent Brahman is independent of time, space

and cause. The space independence is brought out crudely 
in the Upanisads. Brahman is said to be omnipresent, 
all-pervading, infinitely great and infinitely small. “ That 
which is above the heaven, 0 Gargi, and that which is 
beneath the earth, that which men call the past, present 
and future, all that is woven within and throughout in 
space. But wherein then is space woven within and with- 
out ? In truth, in this imperishable one, is space woven 
within and throughout, 0 Gargi.” 1 Brahman is described 
as being free from the limitations of time. It is viewed 
as an eternity without beginning and end, or as an instan- 
taneous duration occupying no definite time interval. He 
is independent of past and future, 2 and lord of all, 3 at 
whose feet time rolls along. 4 In emphasising the independ- 
ence of causal relations Brahman is represented to be an 
absolutely static being, free from all the laws of becom- 
ing of which the universal rule is causality. This way of 
establishing Brahman’s independence of causal relations 
countenances the conception of Brahman as absolute self- 
existence and unchanging endurance, and leads to mis- 
conceptions. Causality is the rule of all changes in the 
world. But Brahman is free from subjection to causality. 
There is no change in Brahman though all change is based 
on it. There is no second outside it, no other distinct 
from it. We have to sink all plurality in Brahman. 
All proximity in space, succession in time, interdependence 
of relations rest on it. The comprehension of this profound 
philosophic synthesis cannot be obtained so long as we 
remain at the level of intellect. The Upanisads assert 
sometimes that thought gives us imperfect, partial pictures 
of reality, and at other times that it is organically incapable 
of reaching reality. It deals with relations and cannot 
grasp the relationless absolute. But there is nothing on 
earth existing in space or time which is not an appearance 
of the absolute. No knowledge is entirely false, though 
none is entirely true. The nearest approach to truth is 
the conception of an organised whole, though it is not 
completely true on account of the relational character which,

however near to cancellation it may have come, is never 
absolutely abolished. It is the highest form of the absolute 
the mind of man can hit upon. Intellect, in the sense of 
mere understanding, working with the limited categories of 
time, space and cause, is inadequate. Reason also fails, 
though it takes us beyond understanding. It does not help 
us to attain reality, which is not merely an idea but a spirit. 
An idea of reason is an imperfect fragment of reality which 
is more than idea. The real is neither true nor false. Our 
judgments about the real may be true or false, since they 
imply the dualism between idea and reality. We have to 
pass beyond thought, beyond the clash of oppositions, 
beyond the antinomies that confront us when we work 
with the limited categories of abstract thinking, if we are 
to reach the real where man’s existence and divine being 
coincide. It is when thought becomes perfected in 
intuition that we catch the vision of the real. The 
mystics the world over have emphasised this fact. Pascal 
dwells on the incomprehensibility of God, and Bossuet 
bids us not to be dismayed by the divergencies, but regard 
them all trustfully as the golden chains that meet beyond 
mortal sight at the throne of God. 

According to the Upanisads there is a higher power 
which enables us to grasp this central spiritual reality. 
Spiritual things require to be spiritually discerned. The 
Yoga method is a practical discipline pointing out the 
road to this realisation. Man has the faculty of divine 
insight or mystic intuition, by which he transcends the 
distinctions of intellect and solves the riddles of reason. 
The chosen spirits scale the highest peak of thought and 
intuit the reality. By this intuitive realisation “ the urn 
heard becomes heard, the unperceived becomes perceived, 
and the unknown becomes known.” 1 The problems raised 
by intellect solve themselves the moment we transcend 
reasoning and start to live the religious life.* The Upani- 
sads ask us therefore to lay aside our pride of intellect 
and self-consciousness, and approach facts with the fresh 
outlook of a child. “ Let a Brahmin renounce learning

and become as a child.” 1 No man shall enter into the 
kingdom of God except he first become as a little child. 
The highest truths are to be felt by the simple and pure- 
minded, and not proved to the sophisticated intellect. 
” Let him not seek after many words, for that is mere weari- 
ness of tongue.” * “ Not by learning is the Atman attained, 
not by genius and much knowledge of books.” 3 It is attained 
by the mystics in their moments of illumination. It is 
direct knowledge or immediate insight. In the mystic 
experience the soul finds itself in the presence of the highest. 
It is lost in awareness, contemplation and enjoyment of 
the ultimate Reality. It does not know what it is when 
it reaches it. There is nothing higher than it. Other 
things are all in it. It then fears no evil, no untruth, but 
is completely blessed. This spiritual vision relieves us 
from all passion and suffering. The soul in its exaltation 
feels itself to be at one with what it sees. Plotinus says : 
“ In the vision of God, that which sees is not reason, but 
something greater than and prior to reason, something 
presupposed by reason, as is the object of vision. He who 
then sees himself, when he sees, will see himself as a simple 
being, will be united to himself as such, will feel himself 
become such. We ought not even to say that he will see, 
but he will be that which he sees, if indeed it is possible 
any longer to distinguish seer and seen, and not boldly to 
affirm that the two are one. He belongs to God and is 
one with Him, like two concentric circles ; they are one 
when they coincide and two only when they are separated.” 4 
All the aspirations of the human mind, its intellectual 
demands, its emotional desires, and its volitional ideals 
are there realised. It is the supreme end of man’s effort, 
the termination of personal life. “ This is the supreme 
end of that, this is the supreme treasure of that, this is 
the supreme dwelling of that, this is the supreme joy of 

1 Brh., iii. 5. 1. This translation is adopted by Deussen and Gough, 
though Max Muller translates thus : " Let a Brahmin after he has done 
with learning wish to stand by real strength." This rests on the inferior

nirvidya balyena tisthaset."

that.” 1 It is on a level with perceptual experience, but, 
unlike the latter, it is not objective and verifiable by others. 
It cannot, like inferential knowledge, be communicated to 
others. It is impossible to give a formal exposition of it. 
The mystic insight is inarticulate. As to a man born blind 
we cannot explain the beauty of a rainbow or the glory 
of a sunset, even so to the non-mystic the vision of the 
mystic cannot be described. " God put it into my head, 
and I cannot put it into yours,” is the last word of the 
mystic experience. Simply because it is incommunicable, 
it does not become less valid than other forms of know- 
ledge. We can describe this experience only by metaphors. 
For the light blinds us and makes us dumb. We cannot 
render a full report of the ineffable. Bahva, when asked 
by king Vaskali to explain the nature of Brahman, kept 
silent, and when the king repeated his request, the sage 
broke out into the answer: “ I tell it to you, but you do not 
understand it, Santo ’yam atma : this Atman is peaceful, 
quiet.”* To any suggested definitions of intellect we can 
only answer, it is not this, it is not this. 3 The negative 
definitions point out how the positive attributes known to 
us are inadequate to the highest. “ There is no measure 
of him whose glory verily is great.” “> Contradictory pre- 
dicates are attached to Brahman to indicate that we are 
obliged to use negative conceptions so long as we employ 
the dialectics of intellect, though positive features are 
revealed when Brahman is intuited. “ It is subtler than 
the subtle, greater than the great.” 5 " It moves, it does 

not move ; it is far and it is near ; it is within all this and 
without all this.” 6 These seemingly inconsistent accounts 
are not the sign of any confusion of thought. 

The absolute is implied in all experience, for every object 
of the world is based on the absolute, though none of them 
expresses it completely. So those who imagine they do not

know the absolute, do know it, though imperfectly; and those 
who think they know the absolute really do not know it 
completely. It is a state of half-knowledge and half- 
ignorance. The Kena Upanisad says: " It is unknown to 
those who know and known to those who do not know.” 1 
The Upanisads do not maintain that intellect is a useless 
guide. The account of reality given by it is not false. It 
fails only when it attempts to grasp the reality in its fullness. 
Everywhere else it succeeds. What the intellect investigates 
is not the unreal, though it is not the absolutely real. The 
antinomies of cause and effect, substance and attribute, 
good and evil, truth and error, subject and object, are due 
to the tendency of man to separate terms which are related. 
Fichte’s puzzle of self and not-self, Kant’s antinomies, 
Hume’s opposition of facts and laws, Bradley’s contradic- 
tions, can all be got over, if we recognise that the opposing 
factors are mutually complementary elements based on one 
identity. Intellect need not be negated, but has only to 
be supplemented. A philosophy based on intuition is not 
necessarily opposed to reason and understanding. Intuition 
can throw light on the dark places which intellect is not 
able to penetrate. The results of mystic intuition require 
to be subjected to logical analysis. And it is only by this 
process of mutual correction and supplementation that 
each can live a sober life. The results of intellect will be 
dull and empty, unfinished and fragmentary, without the 
help of intuition, while intuitional insights will be blind and 
dumb, dark and strange, without intellectual confirmation. 
The ideal of intellect is realised in the intuitive experience, 
for in the supreme are all contraries reconciled. Only by 
the comradeship of scientific knowledge and intuitive ex- 
perience can we grow into true insight. Mere reasoning 
will not help us to it. 2 If we content ourselves with the 
verdict of intellect, then we shall have to look upon the 
plurality and independence of individuals as the final word 
of philosophy. Competition and struggle will be the end 
of the universe Abstract intellect will lead us to false 
philosophy and bad morals. Brahman is concealed by 
such knowledge. 3 The unreflecting attitude is perhaps 

1 ii. 3. * Katha, ii. 9. » Mcdhaya pihitat?. Tait. Up. 



180 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

better than this kind of intellectualism. “ All who worship 
what is not knowledge enter into blind darkness ; those 
who delight in knowledge enter, as it were, into greater 
darkness.” 1 An intellectual knowledge of diversity with- 
out the intuitive realisation is worse than the blind ignorance 
of faith, bad as it is. The contradictions of life and logic 
have to be reconciled in the spirit of Emerson’s Brahma. 

They reckon ill who leave me out ; 

When me they fly I am the wings ; 

I am the doubter and the doubt. 

The one eternal spirit expresses, embraces, unifies and 
enjoys the varied wealth of the world with all its passions 
and paradoxes, loyalties and devotions, truths and contra- 
dictions. Weak souls, unaware of this all-embracing reality, 
grow weary of the fight, intellectual, aesthetic and moral. 
But they have to draw courage from the fact that the joy 
of harmony has to be derived from the struggle of discordant 
elements. The seeming contradictions belong to the life 
of spirit. The one spirit shows its being in all the opposi- 
tions of life and thought, the puzzles of Hume, the problems 
of Kant, the conflicts of empiricism and the dogmas of 
speculation. 

By insisting on intuition more than on thought, on 
ananda more than on vijnana, the Upanisads seem to 
support the non-dualism referred to in the Introduction. 
So long as we skim on the surface of reality with the notions 
of thought, we do not get at the deeper spirit. In ananda 
man is most and deepest in reality. In the unexplored 
depths of individual experience, the inner anandamaya, 
lies the stuff of reality. Intellectual systems disdain to 
descend into the rich mine of life. Whatever is reduced 
to vijnana has become unreal, though it tends to become 
universal and objective. What is not conceptualised or 
categorised is the truly subjective. The organised whole 
of vijnana gives a logical impress to identity. The intuition 
shows up the fact of identity. In trying to know' the identity 
we superficialise it by breaking it into differences and try 
to get them back to the identity by constructing a system. 

1 Brh., lv. 4-10 ; see Isa, ix. 



PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 181 

But the fact once broken into the relations can never 
through mere logic have its oneness restored. As we have 
more than once observed, the first touch of logic is responsible 
for the transformation of the One into a system. 

XI 

Creation 

It is clear from our account of the nature of Brahman 
that the Upanisads are dissatisfied with the materialist 
and vitalist theories of evolution. Matter cannot develop 
life or consciousness unless it had the potentialities of them 
in its nature. No amount of shocks from the external 
environment can extort life out of mere matter. Ananda 
cannot be the end of evolution unless it was also the beginning 
of it. The end is present throughout, though in a suppressed 
form. The individual things of the world possess the 
features of their ultimate source and end. “ Whatever 
there is belonging to the son belongs to the father ; whatever 
there is belonging to the father belongs to the son.” 1 Every- 
thing in the world, not merely the human individual, is 
in essence the ultimate reality itself. Development means 
the manifestation of the potentialities of things by the 
removal of the obstructing energies. From the scientific 
point of view, we notice the different degrees of development 
in the things of the world. The philosopher is interested 
in the common ground of unity. The multiplicity of the 
world is based on the one spirit. “ Who indeed could live, 
who breathe, should not this ananda be in akaia ? ” * The 
sun rises punctually, the stars run in their courses, and all 
things stand in their order and faint not in their watches 
because of the eternal spirit which slumbers not nor sleeps. 
" All shine after Him who shines. By His radiance is all 
this illumined.” 3 Ananda is the beginning and the end 
of the world, the cause as well as the effect, the root as 
Well as the shoot of the universe. 4 The efficient and the

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


final causes are one. The matter with which the process 
of evolution starts is not an independent entity. It ha? 
hidden in it the highest ananda. The course of development 
is a transition from the potential to the actual. Matter 
has more potential in it than life. In the graduated scale 
of the types of existence, the later is the more evolved or 
the formed, and the earlier is the more potential or the 
unformed. To use the words of Aristotle, the earlier is 
the matter and the later is the form. Matter is the passive 
principle which requires to be energised or informed. We 
have in the logical accounts a god overlooking matter, 
stirring it up into motion. This god is prajnana, or the 
eternally active self-conscious reason. 1 He is responsible for 
the whole realm of change. The Upanisads fight shy of 
the conception of an omnipotent mechanic fashioning pre- 
existing matter into the universe. If God excludes matter, 
even though the latter is reduced to a mere potentiality, 
we cannot escape dualism, since God would remain opposed 
to matter. Such a dualism is the characteristic feature 
of the system of Aristotle with its distinction of the first 
mover and the first matter. For the Upanisads, both 
form and matter, the ever active consciousness and the 
passive non-consciousness, are aspects of a single reality. 
Matter itself is a god. 1 Its first forms of fire, water, and 
earth are looked upon as divine, since they are all informed 
by the one spirit. The Samkhya dualism is repugnant to 
the Upanisads. The transcendent reality is the ground 
or explanation of the struggle between spirit and matter. 3 
The whole world is conceived as possessing an identity of 
purpose as well as a common substratum of change. The 
Upanisads bring out in several fanciful and mythological 
accounts of creation the great truth of the oneness of the 
world. Brahman is the sole and the whole explanation 
of the world, its material and efficient cause. The entities 
of the world are knots in the rope of development, which 
begins with matter and ends in ananda.

and then enters it.” 1 * 3 A personal god, Praiapati, tired of 
solitude, draws forth from himself everything that exists, 
or produces the world after having divided himself into 
two, one half male and the other half female.? Sometimes 
the personal or created being is represented as himself pro- 
ceeding from a material substratum. On other occasions, 
the primary substance of things is represented as manifesting 
itself in the created existence. 3 The Atman pervades things 
as the salt which has dissolved in water pervades the water ; 
from the Atman things spring as the sparks fly out from the 
fire, as threads from the spider, or sound from the flute. 4 
The theory of emanation where the bringing of a product 
into existence does not affect the source of the product is 
also suggested. The light coming from the sun leaves 
the sun unchanged. This seems to be the justification 
for the later theory that the individual is a mere abhasa or 
appearance of Brahman . The metaphors of the spinning of the 
web by the spider, the bearing of the child by the mother, the 
production of notes from musical instruments, attempt to 
bring out the intimate relationship between the cause and the 
effect. It is the tadatmya or oneness between Brahman and 
the world that is conveyed in all this wealth of symbol and 
image. The external world is not something separate, 
existing side by side with the Atman. The ultimate ground 
of being, Brahman, and the empirical state of being, the 
world are not different. The world of plurality can be 
reduced without residuum into the everlasting one. Brahman. 
The Upanisads are decisive about the principle that Brah- 
man is the sole source of life in all that lives, the single thread 
binding the whole plurality into a single unity. When the 
problem of the co-existence of the plurality and unity is 
taken up, the Upanisads speak in the language of similes 
and symbols, but do not give any definite answer. We

also the view of Empedocles.

about the relation of the empirical world to Brahman. The 
two cannot be unrelated, for all that is, is one, and yet we 
do not know how precisely they are one. The former 
aspect is brought out in the argument that Brahman is 
the material as well as the efficient cause of the world ; 
the latter when it is said that we do not know anything 
of it at all. It is maya, or mysterious, or anirvacaniya 
(inexplicable), as Samkara puts it. We cannot ask how 
the relationless Brahman is related to the world. The 
presumption is that the world of relations does not in any 
way affect the nature of Brahman. The destruction of 
the world of experience does not in the least take away 
from the being of Brahman. Brahman can exist and does 
exist apart from the world of relations. The world is not 
an essential factor in the existence of Brahman. A reciprocal 
dependence of the world on Brahman and vice versa would 
be to reduce Brahman to the level of the world and subject 
it to the categories of time and purpose. The incapacity 
to define the relation of the absolute to the world is not 
to be construed as a repudiation of the world as a screen 
imagined by the finite man, which hides the absolute. For 
it is declared that the world of space, time and cause has 
its reality in Brahman. The absolute is so far present in 
this world of relations as to enable us to measure the distance 
of the things of the world from the absolute and evaluate 
their grades of reality. Brahman is in the w'orld, though 
not as the world. The Upanisads do not face the question 
directly. The only way to reconcile the several accounts 
is by taking our stand on the absolute self-sufficiency of 
Brahman. The perfection of Brahman implies that all 
the worlds, states and aspects, and all the manifestations, 
past, present and future, are realised in it in such wise 
that they are nothing without it, though it is independent 
of all other existence. If without conforming to the strict 
philosophical position, that we do not know the precise 
relation between the Brahman and the world, we proceed 
f o characterise it, it is truer to say that the world is the 
self-limitation of the supreme than that it is a creation of 
it. For the creation of the world by God would imply

that God was alone once upon a time, and at a certain 
point in His history He created the world. It is not right 
to look upon God as cause antecedent in time to the world 
as effect. It is better to make the world the expression 
of God. As a matter of fact, in many passages the Upani- 
sads declare that the world is only a development of 
the absolute spirit. Nature is a system of spontaneity 
or self-evolving autonomy, since it is the energising of the 
absolute. In this development, the first stage is represented 
by the rise of the two factors of a self-conscious God and 
the passive potentiality of matter. The ultimate fact is 
the self-sufficiency of Brahman, and we cannot say how the 
world is related to it. If we insist on some explanation, 
the most satisfactory one is to make the absolute a unity 
with a difference or a concrete dynamic spirit. We then 
reach the self and the not-self, which interact and develop 
the whole universe . 1 Self-expression becomes the essence 
of the absolute. Activity is the law of life. Force is 


* An attempt is made by Babu Bhagavan Das, in his translation of a 
work called Pranavavada, attributed to Gargyayana, to interpret a great 
saying of the Upanisads, aham etat na, " I not this,” into a highly philoso- 
phical doctrine. Aham or self is the self-conscious Isvara. Etat is nature 
or not-self. The relation between the two is signified by na, a negation. 
" The self is not the not-self ” In the syllable A UM, “ A ” represents the 
self, “ U ” the not-self, and “ M ” the negation of the two, but all these 
three are rolled into the '* AUM," the Prana va. The world is interpreted 
to be a negative reflection of the Aham. It is affirmed by the self for its 
own realisation. Etat is the unreal shadow, while Aham is the reality. 
The interpretation is ingenious ; but we have to remember that what is 
denied is not the Etat (not-self) as the reflexion of Aham (self) but only 
the Etat (not-self) as cut off from Aham (self). The many as separate 
and apart from the One is denied. Brahman the reality causes, if such a 
term is legitimate, all difference. In Indian thought this symbol AUM 
stands for many things. Every kind of trinity is represented by AUM. 
Being, non-being and becoming; birth, life and death; Prakrti, Jlvatman 
and Paramatman ; Sattva, Rajas and Tamas ; past, present and future ; 
Brahma, Visnu and 6iva. The conception of Brahma, Visnu and Siva 
emphasises the different aspects of the one Supreme, which contains the 
three conditions. God by a free act of His will creates, or more philosophically 
posits, an eternal universe. This positing God is Brahma. He views it, 
contemplates it, sustains it, enjoys it as being distinct from himself. This 
God is Visnu. He receives it back into his own unity as an indissoluble 
element of his being, then he is 6iva. Those who imagine that the three 
states are exclusive, postulate three personal agencies embodying the three 
different functions.

inherent in existence. Maya, in the sense of energy, is 
potentially eternal in being. 

There is hardly any suggestion in the Upanisads that the 
entire universe of change is a baseless fabric of fancy, a mere 
phenomenal show or a world of shadows. The artistic and 
poet souls of the Upanisads lived always in the world of 
nature and never cared to fly out of it. The Upanisads 
do not teach that life is a nightmare and the world a barren 
nothing Rather is it pulsing and throbbing with the 
rhythm of the world harmony. The world is God’s revela- 
tion of Himself. His joy assumes all these forms.* But 
there is a popular view which identifies the Upanisad 
doctrine with an abstract monism, which reduces the rich 
life of this world into an empty dream. If we start with 
the facts of everyday experience and try to account for 
them, we are reduced to the two factors of a self-conscious 
Isvara and indeterminate matter. Intellectually we are 
convinced of the oneness of these two. Our difficulty is 
the reconciliation between the two : subject and object 
on the one hand, and the Brahman explicitly asserted by 
the Upanisads on the other. The real is one, yet we have 
the two. It is from this duality that the difference of the 
world arises. We are confronted with a blank wall. If 
philosophy is bold and sincere, it must say that the relation 
cannot be explained. The one somehow becomes two. 
This seems to be the most logical view in the circum- 
stances : “ The immanence of the absolute in finite centres 
and of finite centres in the absolute, I have always set 
down as inexplicable ... to comprehend it is beyond us 
and even beyond all intelligence.” 1 The inexplicabilty 
of the relation between the two is assumed by the Upanisads, 
and the later Vedanta gives to it the name of maya. 

The difficulty of giving a satisfactory explanation is 
traced to the imperfection of the human mind, which employs 
inadequate categories of space, time and cause, which are

self-contradictory. The aspects of the world known to 
them are fragmentary and are not genuinely real. They 
are appearances somehow in and of, but not for reality. 
Everything we come across in our finite experience breaks 
down somewhere or other and becomes . contradictory. 
While all finite experiences are limited and incomplete, 
they are so in different degrees, and it is not right to put 
them all on a general level or give to them all equal reality 
or, more accurately, equal unreality. The doctrine of maya 
gives abstract expression to this general feature of all ex- 
perience of the finite that it falls short of the absolute. 

While intellectual modesty bom of the consciousness 
of human imperfection compelled the thinkers of the 
Upanisads to rest in negative statements of the supreme 
reality, the false imitators of the Upanisad ideal, with an 
extreme of arrogant audacity, declare that Brahman is 
an absolutely homogeneous impersonal intelligence — a most 
dogmatic declaration alien to the true spirit of the 
Upanisads. Such a positive characterisation of the nature 
of Brahman is illogical — for even Samkara says that the 
real is non-dual, advaita, and nothing positive. 

There are passages, according to Thibaut, “ whose 
decided tendency it is to represent Brahman as transcending 
all qualities, as one undifferentiated mass of impersonal 
intelligence .” 1 “ And as the fact of the appearance of the 
manifold world cannot be denied, the only way open to 
thoroughly consistent speculation was to deny at any rate 
its reality, and to call it a mere illusion due to an unreal 
principle, with which Brahman is indeed associated, but 
which is unable to break the unity of Brahman’s nature 
just on account of its own unreality.” 2 Maya, according 
to Thibaut, reconciles the appearance of diversity with the 
reality of the One, but unfortunately the conception of 
an abstract intelligence is a meaningless notion, which is 
disallowed by the anti-dogmatist attitude of the Upanisad 
theory. The Upanisads do not support an abstract con- 
ception of the ultimate reality. Their philosophy is not 
so much a monism as an advaitism (not twoness). The 
distinction of subject and object is not absolute, though

it is real in the world. We cannot split the world into 
two halves of subject and object, for Brahman underlies 
both. While it denies duality, it does not affirm that all 
things could be dissolved into one except in a figurative 
sense . 1 

Other friendly interpreters of the Upanisads also con- 
tend that the Upanisads support the doctrine of maya 
in the sense of the illusoriness of the world. Let us inquire 
into the value of their contention. Deussen, who has 
done much to popularise Vedantic lore in Europe, points 
out that four different theories of creation occur in the 
Upanisads. They are — (i) that matter exists from eternity 
independently of God, which He fashions, but does not 
create ; (2) that God creates the universe out of nothing, 

1 We find that the passages which employ the illustration of clay 
(copper, etc.) to explain the oneness of- Brahman and the world, use 
the words “ vacarambhanam vikaro namadheyam mrttikety eva satyam.” 
Its meaning seems to be that all are modifications of the one sub- 
stance, marked by different names. Samkara interprets this to mean that 
" the modification (vikara) originates and exists merely in speech ; in 
reality there is no such thing as effect. It is merely a name, and there- 
fore unreal." It is vyavaharikam or empirical, but it does not follow that 
it is mithya or falsehood. It has also to be noted that the statement is 
made by Uddalaka, who held a theory of matter which admitted only 
changes of form. The material, according to him, is one continuous whole, 
in which qualitatively distinct particles of matter are mixed together. The 
passage says that the development is noticed by the giving of a different 
name. Name and form are used in the Upanisads to indicate individuality. 
See Brh., i, 4. 7. Development of the one into the many is the rise of 
name and form out of the primary principle. There is no suggestion that 
the modifications denoted by name and form are unreal. They have, 
of course, no reality apart from Brahman. Namariipa is not what the 
English words name and form indicate. They correspond to the form and 
matter of Aristotle. The two together constitute the individuals of the 
world. In Buddhism rupa stands for the gross body and nama for the 
subtle mind. In the Upanisads the development of name and form means 
the individualisation of the One. The individualisation is the principle of 
creation, the central feature of the cosmic process. Things and persons are 
ultimately only modes of the existence of God. They are not real on their 
own account. Only Brahman is so real. Their separateness is superficial. 
Salvation in the Upanisads is the cessation of the sense of separateness of 
namariipa, The Mundaka Upanisad says : " He who has attained the 
highest wisdom unites with the universal spirit, delivered from namariipa as 
the flowing streams enter into rest in the sea, leaving namariipa behind." 
Again, the cause is more real than the effect. God is the cause of all 
persons and things. As gold is the essence of gold ornaments. Brahman is 
the reality of the world, its sattasamanya or common substiatum. 



PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 189 


and the latter is independent of God, although it is His 
creation ; (3) that God creates the universe by trans- 
forming Himself into it ; (4) that God alone is real, and 
there is no creation at all. The last, according to him, is 
the fundamental view of the Upanisads. The world in 
space and time is an appearance, an illusion, a shadow of 
God. To know God we must reject the world of appear- 
ance. What inclines Deussen to this view is his own belief 
that the essence of every true religion is the repudiation 
of the reality of the world. Having come to that conclusion 
on independent grounds, he is anxious to find support for 
his doctrine in the philosophic systems of ancient India, 
the Upanisads and fsamkara, ancient Greece, Parmenides 
and Plato, and modern Germany, Kant and Schopenhauer. 
In his eagerness to find support for his position he is not 
very careful about the facts. He admits that the prevailing 
doctrine of the Upanisads is the pantheistic one, while 
the “ fundamental ” doctrine is the illusion hypothesis. 
That the pantheistic view is the “ prevailing ” one, Deussen 
is obliged to concede by the mere pressure of facts. That 
the illusion view is the “ fundamental ” one is his own 
reading of the facts. Between the two, the fact of pantheism 
and the reading of illusionism, a compromise has to be effected. 
Deussen achieves it by holding that it is a concession to 
clamour and the empirical demands of the unregenerate 
man. “ For the fundamental thought, that is held fast 
at least as a principle at all stages, even at the lowest, which 
maintains the independent existence of matter, is the con- 
viction of the sole reality of the Atman ; only that side by 
side with and in spite of this conviction, more or less far 
reaching concessions were made to the empirical conscious- 
ness of the reality of the universe, that could never be 
entirely cast off.” 1 The first argument urged in support of 
the “ illusion ” hypothesis is that the Upanisads assert 
the sole reality of Brahman. It follows that the world is 
unreal. We agree that Atman is the sole reality. If we 
know it, all else is known. That there is no plurality, no 
change outside it, is admissible. But that there is no change 
at all and no plurality at all, either in or out, such an un- 

* The Philosophy of the Upanisads, pp. 161-* 



190 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

qualified proposition is hard to understand. “ Nature,” 
says Deussen, “ which presents the appearance of plurality 
and change is a mere illusion.” 1 In the same strain 
Mr. Fraser argues : “ This doctrine of the illusion of all 
appearances of reality follows naturally and logically from 
the repeated teachings in the Upanisads regarding the 
non-duality of the self or Atman or Brahman as the sole 
reality of the universe.” 1 In these arguments the infinite 
is taken in a false sense. It is equated with the not -finite ; 
the eternal is made the not-temporal. When the eternal 
becomes a timeless abstraction, the life of the world in 
time becomes unreal. The opposition between the world 
in space and time and the world absolute and eternal is 
ultimate. But the Upanisads nowhere say that the infinite 
excludes the finite. Wherever they assert that Brahman 
is the sole reality they are careful enough to add that the 
world is rooted in Brahman, and as such has a share of 
reality. “The finite is in the infinite. This Atman is the 
entire universe.” 3 It is prana. It is speech. It is mind. 
It is everything in the universe. God is present in the 
vile dust and the small mote.4 The affirmation of the 
real involves the affirmation of all that is based on it. From 
the doctrine of the sole reality of Brahman follows the 
relative reality of what is included in or based on it. 

Deussen urges that “ the passages which declare that 
with the knowledge of the Atman all is known, ‘ deny ' 
the universe of plurality.” We do not admit this conten- 
tion. If the Atman is the universal self embracing within 
it all thinking things and the objects of all thought, if 
there is nothing outside it, then it follows that if it is 
known all else is known. The true knowledge which 
leads us to liberation helps us to realise the one indwell- 
ing spirit. There is no suggestion that the Atman 
and the world exclude each other ; in that case what 
Indra said to Prajapati would be true, and Atman 
which excludes everything definite and distinct, would be

the barest abstraction. If we ignore differences, we reduce 
the absolute to a non-entity. We do not improve the case 
of the absolute by repudiating the relative. The eternal 
need not give away the temporal as null and void. Loyalty 
to the highest experience of man, religious and moral, 
philosophic and aesthetic, requires us to recognise the reality 
of the temporal as rooted in the eternal, of the finite as 
subsisting in the infinite, of man as born from God. To 
deny the contingent and the individual is to falsify the neces- 
sary and the universal. The many passages which declare 
the world to be rooted in Brahman are explained away 
by Deussen as a concession to empirical consciousness. 
The Upanisads would not have seriously put forth doctrines 
about the relativity of the world if it was their view that 
the world was a mere illusion. An unworkable interpre- 
tation is adopted by Deussen, and arbitrary arguments are 
employed to support what is fundamentally unsound. 
Deussen himself, in attempting to give the credit for the 
“ illusion ” hypothesis to the great German philosopher 
Kant, admits that the hypothesis was not really, or perhaps 
explicitly, held by the Upanisad thinkers. For he writes : 
“ There is still always a broad distinction between the one 
Brahman and the multiplicity of his appearances, nor were 
ancient thinkers, or indeed any thinkers before Kant, 
able to rise to the conception that the entire unfolding 
in space and time was a merely subjective phenomenon .” 1 
Deussen correctly suggests that the Upanisads could not 
have held the view of the subjectivity of the world. The 
different theories of creation are enunciated just to point 
out that there is essential dependence between Brahman 

1 P. 103. Deussen seems to interpret Kant in the light of the Upanisads 
and the Upanisads in the light of Kant, with the result that he has prac- 
tr ally misconstrued both. Kant is anxious that his idealism should not be 
confused with 1 ierkcley an subjectivism quite as much as fsamkara is anxious 
that his idealism should not be identified with Buddhistic subjectivism. 
Perhaps with Schopenhauer Deussen thinks that Kant's refutation of 
idealism is a stupid after-thought and a great blunder. It is doubtful 
whether students of Kant would agree with Deussen’s view. The weli- 
known argument of Kant also, which bases immortality on the realisation 
of the moral law implanted in us, a result only attainable by an infinite 
process of approximation, tells not for immortality in the usual sense, but 
for transmigration" (p. 314). 



192 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

and the world. There are passages, we admit, which declare 
that the variegated universe is due to the development of 
name and form from out of the one absolute. These indi- 
cate only that the fundamental essence of all things is the 
one reality, and if we are lost in the name and form world, 
we run the risk of missing the deep-lying essence which 
gives rise to all the variety. This name and form-world 
hides, so to say, the immortal essence . 1 We have to pierce 
behind the veil which surrounds all mortal things. The 
objects in space and time conceal the essence of things. 
The passing semblance of life is in no wise its immortal 
truth. The real being is above these things. He manifests 
himself through the world. The manifestation is at the 
same time a concealment. The more complete is the mani- 
festation, the more is the reality concealed. God hides 
Himself and manifests Himself by drawing a veil over His 
face. The hidden meaning of things is opposed to the 
testimony of the senses. The world, while it manifests His 
glory, conceals His pure absolute nature. The truth, the 
unique substance, the absolute void of phenomena and rid 
of limitations, is covered by the multiplicity and plurality 
of the created universe. The objects of the world, including 
the finite selves, imagine that they are separate and self- 
existent, and seem to be engaged in the work of self-main- 
tenance. They forget that they all spring from an identical 
source, from which they derive sustenance. This belief 
is due to maya or delusion. “ Each little leaf on a tree 
may very naturally have sufficient consciousness to believe 
that it is an entirely separate being, maintaining itself in 
the sunlight and the air, withering away and dying when 
the winter comes on — and there is an end of it. It probably 
does not realise that all the time it is being supported by 

* Brh., i. 6. 3. Amrtam satyena cchannam. The ambiguity of the 
word " sat” is responsible for much of the confusion of the Upanisad view 
of reahty. Sat in one sense means all that exists. The world of change 
and growth is " sat ’’ in this sense. Sat also stands for the reality that 
persists in the midst of all change, the immortal or the amrtam. The 
Taittiriya calls the former sat and the latter tyat. Since tyat is opposed to 
the existent sat, it is sometimes called asat or anrtam (Tait., ii. 6). ^ Usually, 
the permanent reality or Brahman is called sat and the world of change 
asat (Chan., vi. 1 . j ; iii 19, r).

the sap which flows from the trunk of the tree, and that 
in its turn it is feeding the tree too — that its self is the self 
of the whole tree. If the leaf could really understand itself, 
it would see that its self was deeply, intimately connected, 
practically one with the life of the whole tree.” 1 Below 
the separate wave crests of consciousness there is the un- 
fatliQined common depth of life, from which all spirits draw 
the springs of their being. If we look upon the objects as 
separate and self-existent, we erect a screen which shuts 
us fiom the truth. The falsely imagined self -subsistence 
of finite objects clouds the glow of heaven. When we 
penetrate beneath the second causes to the essence of all 
things, the veils fall apart and we see that the principle 
underlying them is the same as that which dw'ells in us. 
It is this need to go behind second causes to realise the 
truth of the oneness of things that is brought out in the 
dialogue between the father and the son in the Chandogya 
Upanisad (vi. io ff.). 

" Fetch me from thence a fruit of the Nyagrodha tree." " Here 
is one. Sir.” “ Break it.” “ It is broken, Sir." “ What do you 
see there ? " '* These seeds, almost infinitesimal." " Break one of 

them." " It is broken. Sir." “ What do you see there ? " " Not 

anything, Sir." 

The father said : " My son, that subtle essence which you do not 
perceive there, of that very essence this great Nyagrodha tree exists. 
Believe it, my son, That which is the subtle essence, in it all that exists 
has its self. It is the True. It is the seif, and thou, O Svetaketu, 
art it.” 

The father points out to the son some typical objects of 
nature in succession and exhorts him to realise the philo- 
sophical truth of the unity of life and the continuity of man's 
life with that of the universe. We cannot easily conceive 
this one realitjr which is concealed by the many objects. We 
are too worldly, too experienced, too serious about our- 
selves for that realisation. We live on the surface, cling to 
forms, worship appearance. 

Deussen ignores the central truth of the Upanisad 
philosophy when he holds that according to it “ the whole 
universe, all children, possessions and wisdom,” must “ vanish 

1 Edward Carpenter : Pagan and Christian Creeds, p. 30 u 



194 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

into the nothingness, which they really are.” 1 On this 
hypothesis it is necessary to explain away all those passages 
which declare Brahman, the sustainer of the universe, to 
be one with the psychical principle of the individual self, 
on the principle of accommodation. “ The same spirit of 
accommodation lies at the basis of the form assumed by 
the doctrine of Brahman as a psychical principle.” 2 “ The 

Upanisads find a peculiar pleasure in identifying the Atman 
as the infinitely small within us with the Atman as the 
infinitely great outside us.” 3 When we are in trouble, 
we have no more to bring in God, but only make concession 
to weak human nature. 

“ Metaphysical knowledge impugns the existence of any 
reality outside of the Atman, that is the consciousness. The 
empirical view, on the contrary, teaches that a manifold 
universe exists externally. From a combination of these 
antagonistic propositions originated the doctrine that the 
universe is real, and yet the Atman remains the sole reality, 
for the Atman is the universe.” 4 It is not easy to under- 
stand how the two propositions are antagonistic and the 
conclusion an irreconcilable compromise. When it is said 
that there is no reality outside Atman, it is meant that the 
Atman is the universal spirit or consciousness, including all 
else. When it is said that “ a manifold universe exists 
external to us,” the “ us ” refers to the empirical individuals 
who are limited by mind and body, possessing local habi- 
tations and temporal settings. Surely to such beings the 
world is real, being set over against them. The Atman we 
are in search of is not the object of knowledge but the 
basis of all knowledge. It is the presupposition of material 
and spiritual worlds alike. The thinking beings or jxvas, 
the psychological selves, are part of the world of nature. 
In that world they externally act on other beings and are 
acted on by them. But logically Atman is the condition 
of there being a world of related objects at all. All existence 
is existence for self. The world is beyond us as psycho- 
logical selves. It is there within the universal self. The 
conclusion states, the universe is real to us, for we are not 
yet perfect selves. Atman is the sole reality, and it includes 
1 P, i6S. * P. 1 71. ' P. 237. 4 P. 405. 



PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 195 


the universe also. Any other position would be illogical. 
As empirical selves we are opposed by the world, limited 
by the objects. As our life, which is first opposed to matter, 
gradually absorbs and remoulds into itself the mechanical 
side of things, even so the subject has to transfigure the 
object. Then what was at the start external and objective 
becomes only a condition of the subject’s activity. This 
process goes on steadily till the subject completely dominates 
the object and becomes all in all. Then there would be 
no obstacle outside the subject, but till then the goal is 
not reached. The annulling of the opposition is the sign 
of spirit’s growth. The conclusion that the world is a mere 
appearance would follow if the individual subject, this 
particular link in the chain of evolution, bound by space 
and time, be looked upon as the absolute reality. If we, 
as we are, were Brahman, if we were the sole reality, then 
the world opposed to us would be a mere magic show. 
But the self asserted to be the sole reality is the perfect 
self, which we have yet to become. To that perfect self, 
which includes all that is within and without us, there is 
nothing opposed. It is a confusion between the finite self 
of man, with all its discord and contradiction, and the 
ultimate self of Brahman, that suggests to Deussen an 
imaginary antagonism which he tries to overcome by an 
artificial device. 

There are some passages which say that we ought not 
to see plurality (nana) in Brahman . 1 These passages try 
to indicate the oneness of the world. The emphasis is on 
the one infinite and not the many finites. In our waking 
life we imagine the opposition between the subject and 
the object to be real. Sober reflection tells us that the 
opposition is not ultimate. Duality of subject and object 
is not the ultimate truth. When it is said that duality is 
not all, that duality is not final, it does not mean that 
there is no duality at all, that there is no distinction or 
variety. It is this false view of one school of Buddhism 
that Samkara protests against. So long as we imagine 
the world to be due to something else than the absolute 
we are lost. It is the existence of a factor separate from

Atman that the Upanisads protest against. Arguing from 
the similes of salt and water, fire and sparks, spider and 
threads, flute and sound, employed by the Upanisads 
to represent the relation of Brahman to the world. Olden- 
berg says : " We can detect behind these similitudes by 
which men strove to bring the living power of the Atman 
in the universe near to their understanding, a conviction, 
though at the same time but a half-conscious conviction, 
of the existence of an element in things separate from 
the Atman. The Atman, says the Indian, pervades the 
universe, as the salt the water in which it has dissolved, 
but we may easily go on to add, as a complement to this, 
that although no drop of the salt water is without salt, 
the water continues, notwithstanding, to be something 
separately constituted from the salt. And thus we may 
infer the Atman is to the Indian certainly the sole actuality, 
light diffusing, the only significant reality in things, but 
there is a remainder left in things which he is not." It is 
against such a view that the repudiations of dualism are 
intended. The Upanisads make it clear that they do not 
mean to make the world of creation stand separate from 
the Atman. They seem to be clamourously insisting on 
the adequacy of the Atman to all experience. Unlike 
abstract idealism, the Upani?ad doctrine is distinguished 
by its resolute devotedness to fact. Its highest principle 
or God is the eternal spirit, 1 * * which transcends and includes 
the objective world 1 and the subjective man.3 In the 
highest state there is only one Brahman. “ We see nothing 
else, hear nothing else, know nothing else.” 4 In the supreme 
illumination of the soul 5 we feel the oneness of subject 
and object, the relativity of the world, the non-ultimate 
nature of the oppositions. “ There is neither day nor night 
remaining any more, no existence, no non-existence — only 
God alone." 6 St. Paul says : “ When that which is perfect 
is come, then that which is in part shall be done away.” 
Similarly Ruysbroeck: "The fourth mode is a state of 
emptiness made one with God in bare love and in divine

light. ... So that a man forgetteth himself and knoweth 
neither himself nor God, nor any creature, nor aught else 
but love alone.” It is this integral oneness of intuitive 
experience that is indicated by all those passages which 
ask us to see no distinction in the highest. 

We admit that according to the Upanisads, plurality, 
succession in time, co-existence in space, relations of cause 
and effect, oppositions of subject and object, are not the 
highest reality. But this is not saying that they are non- 
existent. The Upanisads support the doctrine of maya only 
in the sense that there is an underlying reality containing 
all elements from the personal God to the telegraph post. 
Saihkara says: "That Atman is in the hearts of all living 
creatures, from Brahma to a reed.” The different grades 
of individuality are all broken lights of the one absolute. 
Maya represents at the conceptual level the self-distinction 
residing in the very heart of reality, propelling it to develop 
itself. The particular things are and are not. They have 
an intermediate existence. Measured by the perfection of 
the absolute, the unlimited fullness of the one reality, the 
world of plurality, with all its pain and disruption, is less 
real. Compared with the ideal of the supreme one, it is 
wanting in reality. Even if we look upon the persons and 
things of the world as shadows of a substance, still, so long as 
the substance is real, the shadows also have relative reality. 
Though the things of the world are imperfect representations 
of the real, they are not illusory semblances of it. The 
oppositions and conflicts which are in the foreground are 
relative modes of the absolute unity, which is in the back- 
ground. Duality and manyness are not the reality . 1 

The unreflecting consciousness hastily assumes that the 
finite world is absolutely real. This is not so. The forms 
and energies of the world are not final and ultimate. They 
themselves need explanation. They are not self-originated 
or self-maintained. There is something behind and beyond 
them. We must sink the universe in God, the finite in 
the infinite, the real of uncritical perception in the Brahman 
of intuition. There is no suggestion in the Upanisads

that the objects which lie around us on every side in infinite 
space, to which by virtue of our bodily frames we all belong, 
are only apparitions. 

There has been much criticism of the theory of the 
Upanisads under the false impression that it supports 
the illusory nature of the world. It is contended that 
progress is unreal because progress is change, and change 
is unreal since time in which change occurs is unreal. But 
the whole charge is due to a misconception. It is true that 
the absolute is not in time, while time is in the absolute. 
Within the absolute we have real growth, creative evolution. 
The temporal process is an actual process, for reality mani- 
fests itself in and through and by means of the temporal 
changes. If we seek the real in some eternal and timeless 
void, we do not find it. All that the Upanisads urge is 
that the process of time finds its basis and significance in 
an absolute which is essentially timeless. For real progress 
this conception of the absolute is necessary. Without this 
all-comprehending absolute we cannot be certain that the 
flux of the universe is an evolution, that change is progress, 
and that the end of the world is the triumph of the 
good. The absolute guarantees that the process of the 
world is not chaotic but ordered ; that the development 
is not haphazard or the result of chance variations. Reality 
is not a series of disconnected states. Were it so, were 
there not an absolute, we should be landed in an endless 
process, which would have no plan or purpose underlying it. 
The unity of the absolute functions throughout the process 
of the evolution of the world. We are not impotently 
struggling to realise something which is not yet and can 
never be. In a sense the real is expressed at every moment 
of its history. Being and becoming, that which is and that 
which is to be, are identical. With such a view, the teaching 
of the Upanisads is in essential harmony. They do not 
support the doctrine of the world illusion. Hopkins says: 
“ Is there anything in the early Upanisads to show that 
the authors believed in the objective world being an illu- 
sion ? Nothing at all .” 1

Degrees of Reality 

So far as the absolute is concerned, there are no degrees 
at all. The conception of degrees has meaning only for 
the finite intelligence which distinguishes things. It has 
no ultimate value. When the manyness of the world is 
taken over into the one, the conception of degrees is trans- 
cended. In the metaphysical reality of the Upanisads 
we have no scale of reals. Yet it has significance in the 
world of experience. All progress in the world involves it. 
Any demand for advance and alteration in existence pre- 
supposes it. The approximation to the character of the 
real in the relative world of things is the test of the more 
or less of reality. We know enough of the ultimate to make 
use of it in this world. This view of the Upanisads is 
defended by Samkara. In reply to the dilemma. Is Brahman 
known or is it not known ?, if known, we need not inquire 
into its nature ; if not known, it will not be worth our while 
to inquire, Samkara says that reality as self is indubitably 
known. It posits itself in such sayings as " I question,” 
or “ I doubt.” That something is real is a self-evident truth, 
and it is its nature that we have to understand. This reality 
which we realise serves as the criterion to distinguish degrees 
in existence. The theory of the world illusion is inconsistent 
with the conception of degrees of reality. The Upanisads 
give us a hierarchy of different grades of reality down from 
the all-embracing absolute, which is the primary source 
as well as the final consummation of the world process. 
The different kinds of being are higher and lower manifesta- 
tions of the one absolute spirit. For nothing on earth 
stands alone, however relatively complete and self-subsisting 
it may appear. Every finite object holds within itself 
distinctions which point beyond. While the absolute is 
in all finite things and permeates them, the things differ

in the degree of their permeability, in the fullness of the 
reflections they give forth. 

Not all parts like, but all alike informed 

With radiant light. . . . 

There is a richer revelation of reality in organised life than 
in brute matter, more in human society than in organised 
life. The rank of the categories as higher and lower is 
determined by the adequacy of their expression of reality. 
Life is a higher category than matter. Self-conscious 
thought is more concrete than mere consciousness. “ He 
who knows the gradual development of the self in him 
obtains himself more development. There are herbs and 
trees and all that is animal, and he knows the self gradu- 
ally developing in them. For in herbs and trees sap only 
is seen, but citta or consciousness in animated being. 
Among animated beings, again, the self develops gradually, 
for in some sap is seen (as well as consciousness), but in 
others consciousness is not seen, and in man, again, the self 
develops gradually, for he is most endowed with knowledge. 
He says what he has known, he sees what he has known. 
He knows what is to happen to-morrow, he knows the 
visible and the invisible worlds. By means of the mortal 
he desires the immortal — thus is he endowed. With regard 
to other animals, hunger and thirst are a kind of under- 
standing. But they do not say what they have known, 
nor do they see what they have known. They do not 
know what is to happen to-morrow, nor the visible and the 
invisible worlds. They go so far and no farther .” 1 
We see that though the same reality is seen “ in the star, 
in the stone, in the flesh, in the soul and the clod,” 
still it is seen more fully in living beings than in dead 
matter, in developing man than in the satisfied beast, in 
the spiritual life than in the intellectual . 3 In this process

born of egg, apijaja, like crows and ducks; those bom of moisture, svedaja, 
like worms and insects ; and those born of earth, udbhijja, like plants (in. 3). 
The classification proceeds on the mode of appearance of the different beings 
on earth. See also Manu, i. 43-46. Aristotle speaks of vegetable, animal 
and human souls. Leibniz classifies living beings into plants, animals and men.

of self-realisation or self-fulfilment the lowest is the earth. 
The Upanisad thinkers have advanced on the Vedic con- 
ception of a single element-water. Sometimes three ele- 
ments of fire, water and earth are admitted. 1 * The five 
elements of ether, air, fire, water and earth, are distinguished. 
" From that self (Brahman) sprang forth ether" (akasa) ; 
from ether air, from air fire, from fire water, from water 
earth. From earth herbs, from herbs food, from food seed, 
from seed man. Man thus consists of the essence of food.” 3 
In discussing the physical basis of life the author gives an 
account of the evolution of matter. The higher possesses 
the properties of the lower. Ether comes first, with the 
single property of sound. It is that through which we 
hear. From ether we proceed to air, whicn nas the property 
of ether, and in addition that of tangibility. It is that 
through which we hear and feel. From air comes fire. It 
is that by which we hear, feel and see. From fire we get 
to water. We can taste it also. From water comes earth, 
that by which we hear, feel, see, taste and smell. Though 
the science presupposed might appear to be fanciful at 
the present day, still there was a principle involved in the 
account. It is in the Upanisads that we have for the 
first time the doctrine of the five elements. The distinction 
of the elemental essence or the tanmatra and the gross 
embodiment or substance is suggested.3 The Chandogya 
Upanisad sometimes suggests that the things of the world 
are qualitatively distinct from one another, and may be 
divided into infinite parts. Uddalaka propounds the theory 
that matter is infinitely divisible and qualitatively distinct. 
There is no such thing as the transformation of things into 
one another. When we get butter from churning curds, 
curds do not get transformed into butter, but the particles 
of butter are already in the curds, and the process of churning 
enables them to rise upwards. 4 The position of Anaxagoras, 

1 By the combination of these three, all other bodies are formed. See 
Chandogya Up., vi. 2. 3-4. Possibly this view is the origin of the Samkhya 
doctrine of tanmatras or subtle essences, giving rise to gross substances.

that different kinds of matter interpenetrate each other, 
is similar to this : “If then an empirical fact, such as th» 
assimilation of nutriment, appears to show us the conver- 
sion (say) of com into flesh and bone, we must interpret 
this as meaning that the corn contains in itself, in such 
minute quantities as to be imperceptible, just that into 
which it is transformed. It veritably consists of particles 
of flesh and blood, and marrow and bone.” 1 The atomic 
theory of Kanada is also suggested in the view that the 
particles only combine and separate. Matter is represented 
as a chaotic mass, like the juices of various trees blended 
together in honey.* It is not impossible to see in this the 
germs of the Samkhya theory. The development of matter 
is accounted for by either the entry of the jlvatman into 
matter or the animation of matter by spirit in varying 
degrees. Sometimes the principle of motion is located 
within matter itself. Prana or life, though it arises out of 
matter, is not fully explicable by matter. Similarly, con- 
sciousness, though it arises from life, is not intelligible on 
the hypothesis of prana or vitalism. When we get to man 
we have self-conscious thought. Man is higher than stones 
and stars, beasts and birds, since he can enter into the 
fellowship of reason and will, affection and conscience, 
yet he is not the highest, since he feels the pain of contra- 
diction. 

Before we pass from this section let us consider whether 
the Upanisad doctrine is rightly regarded as pantheistic. 
Pantheism is the view which identifies God with the sum 
of things and denies transcendence. If the nature of the 
absolute is exhausted completely by the course of the 
world, if the two become one, then we have pantheism. 
In the Upanisads we come across passages which declare 
that the nature of reality is not exhausted by the world 
process. The existence of the world does not take away 
from the perfection of the absolute. In a beautiful image 
it is said : “That is full and this is full. From that full 
rises this full. Taking away this full from that, what re- 
mains is yet full.” Even God in transforming Himself into

PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 203 


the world has forfeited nothing of His nature. As early 
as the Rg-Veda it is said that all beings are only a fourth 
of the Purusa, while the three other fourths remain im- 
mortal in the shining regions. 1 According to the Brhad 
aranyaka (v. 14), one foot of Brahman consists of the 
three worlds, the second of the triple knowledge of the 
Veda, the third of the three vital breaths, while the fourth, 
exalted above the dust of earth, shines as the sun. 2 The 
Upanisads declare that the universe is in God. But they 
never hold that the universe is God. God is greater than 
the universe, which is His work. He is as much and more 
beyond this, as the human personality is beyond the body, 
which is the instrument of its life here. They refuse to 
imprison God in the world. From this it does not follow 
that God is the external Creator existing separate from the 
world. God expresses Himself in the world, and the world 
is the expression of His life. God in the infinite fullness of 
His being transcends His actual manifestations in the 
universe of finite, physical and psychical entities which 
He has called into existence. God is transcendent as well 
as immanent. The Upanisads are not pantheistic in the 
bad sense of the term. Things are not thrown together 
into a heap called God, without unity, purpose or distinc- 
tion of values. The philosophy of the Upanisads revolts 
against the deistic conception of God. It does not say 
that God is outside the world, and now and again makes 
His presence felt by supernatural revelation or miraculous 
interference. It is pantheism, if it is pantheism to say 
that God is the fundamental reality of our lives, and we 
cannot live without Him. Everything on earth is finite 
and infinite, perfect and imperfect. Everything seeks a 
good beyond itself, tries to rid itself of its finiteness and 
become perfect. The finite seeks self-transcendence. This 
clearly establishes that the Infinite Spirit is working in the 
finite. The real is the basis of the unreal. If the doctrine 
of the indwelling of the divine is enough justification for 
condemning a system as pantheism, the philosophy of the 
Upanisads is a pantheism. But pantheism in this sense 
is an essential feature of all true religion.

The Individual Self 

The Upanisads make out that of finite objects the 
individual self has the highest reality. It comes nearest 
to the nature of the absolute, though it is not the absolute 
itself. There are passages where the finite self is looked 
upon as a reflection of the universe. The whole world is 
the process of the finite striving to become infinite, and this 
tension is found in the individual self. According to the 
Taittiriya the several elements of the cosmos are found in 
the nature of the individual. In the Chandogya Upanisad 
(vi. ii. 3 and 4) fire, water and earth are said to constitute 
the jlvatman or the individual soul, together with the prin- 
ciple of the infinite. 1 

Man is the meeting-point of the various stages of reality. 
Prana corresponds to Vayu, the breath of the body to the 
wind of the world, manas to akasa, the mind of man to the 
ether of the universe, the gross body to the physical elements. 
The human soul has affinities with every grade of existence 
from top to bottom. There is in it the divine element 
which we call the beatific consciousness, the ananda state, 
by which at rare moments it enters into immediate relations 
with the absolute. The finite self or the embodied soul 
is the Atman coupled with the senses and mind. 1 

The different elements are in unstable harmony. “ Two

See also Aitareya, iii. 3 ; 3 vetasvatara, ii. 12. 6 ; Prasna, vi. 11. The 
individual subject is the world in miniature, and the world is the individual 
writ large. Plato in his Timceus institutes an analogy between the macro- 
cosm and the microcosm, the universe and man. The soul of the world is 
said to be compounded by God Himself out of the changeless and the change- 
ful and inserted in the midst of the universe (34. B). The universe, according 
to him, is a magnified man. See Tait., i. 3, and Anandagiri’s com- 
mentary on it.

birds, akin and friends, cling to the self-same tree. One 
of them eats the sweet berry, but the other gazes upon 
him without eating. In the same tree — the world tree — 
man dwells along with God. With troubles overwhelmed, 
he faints and grieves at his own helplessness. But when 
he sees the other, the Lord in whom he delights — ah, what 
glory is his, his troubles pass away.” 1 The natural and 
the divine have not as yet attained a stable harmony. 
The being of the individual is a continual becoming, a 
striving after that which it is not. The infinite in man 
summons the individual to bring about a unity out of the 
multiplicity with which he is confronted. This tension 
between the finite and the infinite which is present through- 
out the world-process comes to a head in the human con- 
sciousness. In every aspect of his life, intellectual, emo- 
tional and moral, this struggle is felt. He can gain admission 
into the kingdom of God, where the eternal verities of 
absolute love and absolute freedom dwell only by sinking 
his individuality and transforming the whole of the finite- 
ness into infiniteness, humanity into divinity. But as finite 
and human, he cannot reach the fruition or attain the final 
achievement. The being in which the struggle is witnessed 
points beyond itself, and so man has to be surpassed. The 
finite self is not a self-subsisting reality. Be he so, then 
God becomes only another independent individual, limited 
by the finite self. The reality of the self is the infinite ; the 
unreality which is to be got rid of is the finite. The 
finite individual loses whatever reality he possesses if the 
indwelling spirit is removed. It is the presence of the 
infinite that confers dignity on the self of man. The indi- 
vidual self derives its being and draws its sustenance from 
the universal life. Sub specie ceternitatis, the self is perfect . 1 
There is a psychological side on which the selves repel each 
other and exclude one another. From this apparent fact 
of exclusiveness we should not infer real isolation of selves. 
The exclusiveness is the appearance of distinction. It 
ought to be referred to the identity, otherwise it becomes 
a mere abstraction of our minds. The hypothesis of ex-

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


elusive selves leaves no room for the ideals of truth, goodness 
and love. These presuppose that man is not perfect as 
he is, that there is something higher than the actual self 
which he has to attain to secure peace of mind. “ And 
the independent reality of the individual, when we examine 
it, is in truth mere illusion. Apart from the community, 
what are separate men ? It is the common mind within 
him which gives reality to the human being, and taken 
by himself, whatever else he is, he is not human. ... If 
this is true of the social consciousness in its various forms, 
it is true certainly no less of that common mind which is 
more than social. The finite minds that in and for religion 
form one spiritual whole have indeed in the end no visible 
embodiment, and yet, except as members in an invisible 
community, they are nothing real. For religion, in short, 
if the one indwelling spirit is removed, there are no spirits 
left.” * 

Though the individual soul fighting with the lower 
nature is the highest in the world, it is not the highest 
realisable. The striving discordant soul of man should 
attain to the freedom of spirit, the delight of harmony 
and the joy of the absolute. Only when the God in him 
realises itself, only when the ideal reaches its fruition is 
the destiny of man fulfilled. The struggles, the contra- 
dictions and the paradoxes of life are the signs of imperfect 
evolution, while the harmony, the delight and the peace, 
mark the perfection of the process of evolution. The in- 
dividual is the battlefield in which the fight occurs. The 
battle must be over and the pain of contradiction trans- 
cended for the ideal to be realised. The tendency to God 
which begins in completed man will become then a perfect 
fruition. Man is higher than all other aspects of the uni- 
verse, and his destiny is realised when he becomes one 
with the infinite. Nature has life concealed in it, and 
when life develops, nature’s destiny is fulfilled. Life has 

consciousness concealed in it, and when it liberates con- 
sciousness, its end is reached. The destiny of consciousness 
is fulfilled when intellect becomes manifest. But the truth 
of the intellect is reached when it is absorbed in the higher

intuition, which is neither thought nor will nor feeling, 
but yet the goal of thought, the end of will and the per- 
fection of feeling. When the finite self attains the supreme, 
the godhead from which it descended, the end of spiritual 
life is reached. “ When to a man who understands, the 
self has become all things, what sorrow, what trouble, can 
there be to him, who has once beheld that unity ? ”

The Ethics of the Upanisads 

In estimating the value of the ethics of the Upanisads 
we have to consider the logical implications of the ideal 
set forth, and develop the suggestions made in the texts. 
From our previous discussion, it is obvious that the Upani- 
sads have for their ideal the becoming one with God. 
The world is not for itself. It issues from God, and must 
therefore seek its rest in God. Throughout the process of 
the world we witness this infinitisation of the finite. Like 
the rest of the world, man, feeling the pressure of the infinite 
in him, reaches out his hands to clasp the highest. “ All 
birds go towards the tree intended for their abode, so all 
this goes to the supreme self.” 1 “ May I enter Thee, such 

as Thou art, O, Lord ; may Thou, 0 Lord, enter me. . . . 
May I become well cleansed, O Lord.” 2 “ Thou art my 

resting-place.” 3 The realisation of the oneness with God 
is the ideal of man. The difference between human con- 
sciousness and all else is that while all seek the infinite, 
man alone has an idea of the end. After ages of develop- 
ment man has become conscious of the great scheme of 
the universe. He alone feels the summons of the infinite, 
and consciously grows towards the heavenly stature awaiting 
him. The absolute is the deliberate goal of the finite self. 

That it is the highest perfection, the most desirable ideal, 
is brought out in many ways. It is a state “ far above 
hunger and thirst, above sorrow and confusion, above old 
age and death.” “As the sun, the eye of the universe,

remains far off and unaffected by all sickness that meets 
the eye, so also the One, the Atman, who dwells in all 
creatures, dwells afar and untouched by the sorrows of 
the world.” To live in the world of plurality, staking all 
on the small self, subject to disease and suffering, is indeed 
a misfortune. The undoing of the causes which lead to 
finite existence is the proper aim of man. A return from 
the plurality into the One is the ideal goal, the most ultimate 
value. It gives satisfaction to the whole being of man. 
It is, according to the Taittiriya Upanisad, “ Pranaramam 
mana-anandam, £antisamrddham amrtam,” " the delight 
of life and mind, the fullness of peace and eternity.” Lower 
goals which we crave after may satisfy the vital organism 
or the mental desires, but this includes them and transcends 
them. We have different kinds of pleasures answering to 
the different levels of our existence, the vital pleasure, 
the sensuous, the mental and the intellectual, but the 
highest is ananda. 

Whatever ethics we have in the Upanisads is subsidiary 
to this goal. Duty is a means to the end of the highest 
perfection. Nothing can be satisfying short of this highest 
condition. Morality is valuable only as leading to it. It 
is the expression of the spiritual impulse to perfection 
implanted in the heart of man, the instinct of the individual 
soul. It is obedience to the Eternal Reality which constrains 
our conscious self. This is the meaning of the expression 
that duty is “ the stern daughter of the voice of God.” 
The perfect ideal of our life is found only in the Eternal 
Reality. The law of morality is an invitation to become 
perfect, “ even as your heavenly Father is perfect.” 

Before we take up the discussion of the ethical life, we may 
consider the objections urged generally against the possi- 
bility of ethics in the philosophical system of the Upanisads. 
If all is one, it is asked, how can we have moral relations ? 
If the absolute is perfection, where is there any need for 
the effort to realise what is already accomplished ? But 
monism does not mean an obliteration of the distinction of 
good and evil. The sense of otherness and multiplicity 
essential to ethical life is allowed for by the Upanisads 
They point out that there is no meaning in asking us to 



PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 209 

t 

love our neighbour or achieve the unity of the world in 
love, if exclusiveness and difference are fundamental in the 
lives of men. If men were really external to each other, 
as the Leibnizean monads, without the corrective of the 
pre-established harmony, then the ethical ideal is impossible 
of realisation. If we are called upon to love our neighbour, 
it is because all are one in reality. My neighbour and 
myself are one in our inmost self, if the superficial and 
ephemeral distinctions are transcended. The true self, 
absolutely and eternally valid, is beyond the fluctuating 
particulars of time and space and all that finds its place 
in them. It is no mere empty phrase to be told to transcend 
our exclusiveness. Moksa literally means release, release 
from the bondage to the sensuous and the individual, the 
narrow and the finite. It is the result of self-enlargement 
and freedom. To live in perfect goodness is to realise one’s 
life in all. This ideal for which the moral nature of man 
cries can be attained only if the finite self transcends its 
narrow individuality and identifies itself with the whole, 
The path of deliverance is the path of soul growth. The 
reality in which we are to abide by transcending our in- 
dividuality is the highest, and that is the reality asserted 
by the Upanisads. 

It is urged that there is no room for any ethical en 
deavour on the hypothesis that man is divine in nature 
Simply because it is said that God is in man, it does not 
follow that with it there is an end of all endeavour. God is 
not in man in such an obvious fashion that he can possess 
Him absentmindedly and without effort or struggle. God is 
present as a potentia or a possibility. It is man’s duty 
to lay hold of Him by force and action. If he does not 
do it, he fails in his duty as man The God in man is a 
task as well as a fact, a problem as well as a possession. 
Man in his ignorance identifies himself with the external 
wrappings, the physical and mental envelopments. Desire 
for the absolute conflicts with his finitude or his limitation. 
“ Though the individual is lit with the divine spark, he is 
not wholly divine. His divinity is not an actuality, but 
a part of God aspiring to be the whole. As he is, he is dust 
and deity, God and brute crossed. It is the task of the 



210 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

moral life to eliminate the non-divine element, not by des- 
troying it, but by suffusing it with the divine spirit .” 1 
Man is a contradiction between the finite heritage of nature 
and the infinite ideals of spirit, and by a gradual submission 
of the chaotic principles of nature to the divine spirit he 
has to work up to his destiny. It is his aim to break the 
shell of his own little being and blend in love and perfect 
union with the divine principle. The problem of morality 
has a significance for man whose life is a struggle or a war- 
fare between the finite and the infinite, the demoniac and 
the divine elements. Man is born for the struggle, and 
does not find his self until he feels the opposition. 

From the references in the Upanisads to the different 
ways of attaining the highest, Rathitara’s truth, Paurusisti’s 
austerity and Maudgalya’s learning,* it is clear that the 
thinkers of the period reflected a good deal on the problems 
of ethics. Without attempting to elaborate the views 
of the different thinkers, we may describe certain general 
propositions accepted by them all. 

The ideal of ethics is self-realisation. Moral conduct is 
self-realised conduct, if by the self we mean not the empirical 
self, with all its weakness and vulgarity, selfishness and 
smallness, but the deeper nature of man, free from all fetters 
of selfish individuality. The lusts and passions of the 
animal self, the desires and ambitions of egoism, restrict 
the vital energies to the plane of the lower self and contract 
the life of the soul, and they are to be held in check. For the 
growth of the soul, or the realisation of the highest, the 
obstacles and influences must be subdued. The moral 
life is one of understanding and reason, and not of mere 
sense and instinct. " Know the self or Atman as the Lord 
who sits in the chariot called the body, buddlii or intelli- 
gence is the charioteer, mind is the reins, the senses are 
the horses, and the objects are the roads. The self, the 
senses and the mind combined, the intelligent call the 
enjoyer. But he who has no understanding, but is weak 
in mind, his senses run riot like the vicious horses of a 
charioteer. He who has understanding, and is strong-

PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 211 


minded, his senses are well controlled, like the good horses 
of a charioteer. He who is without understanding, who 
is thoughtless and impure, never reaches the immortal, 
immaterial state, but enters into the round of birth. But 
he who has understanding, and he who is thoughtful and 
pure, reaches the state from which there is no return.” 1 * 3 
The drive of desire has to be checked. When desire seizes 
the helm the soul suffers shipwreck, since it is not the law 
of man’s being. Tf we do not recognise the ideal prescribed 
by reason, and do not accept a higher moral law, our life 
will be one of animal existence, without end or aim, where 
we are randomly busy, loving and hating, caressing and 
killing without purpose or reason. The presence of reason 
reminds us of something higher than mere nature, and re- 
quires us to transform our natural existence into a human 
one, with meaning and purpose. If, in spite of indications 
to the contrary, we make pleasure the end of our pursuits, 
our life is one of moral evil, unworthy of man. “ Man is 
not in the least elevated above mere animalism by the 
possession of reason, if his reason is only employed in the 
same fashion as that in which animals use their instincts.” 1 
Only the wicked make gods of the things of the world and 
worship them. “ Now Virocana, satisfied in his thought, 
went to the asuras and preached to them the doctrine that 
the bodily self alone is to be worshipped, that it alone is 
to be served, and he who worships body and serves it gains 
both worlds — this and the next. Therefore they call even 
now a man who does not give alms here, who has not faith, 
and offers no sacrifices, an asura, for this is the doctrine 
of the asuras.” 3 Our life, when thus guided, will be at 
the mercy of vain hopes and fears. “ The rational life 
will be marked by unity and consistency. The different 
parts of human life will be in order and make manifest 
the one supreme ideal. If, instead of reason, our senses 
guide us, our life will be a mirror of passing passions and 
temporary inclinations. He who leads such a life will have 
to be written down, like Dogberry, an ass. His life, which

212 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

will be a series of disconnected and scattered episodes, 
will have no purpose to take, no work to carry out, no end 
to realise. In a rational life, every course of action, before 
it is adopted, is brought before the bar of reason, and its 
capacity to serve the highest end is tested, and if found 
suitable adopted by the individual.” 1 

A life of reason is a life of unselfish devotion to the 
world. Reason tells us that the individual has no interests 
of his own apart from the whole, of which he is a part. 
He will be delivered from the bondage to fortune and 
caprice only if he gives up his ideas of separate sensuous 
existence. He is a good man who in his life subordinates 
personal to social ends, and he is a bad man who does the 
opposite. The soul in committing a selfish deed imposes 
fetters on itself, which can be broken only by the reassertion 
of the life universal. This way of sympathy is open to 
all and leads to the expansion of the soul. If we want 
to escape from sin, we must escape from selfishness. We 
must put down the vain conceits and foolish lies about 
the supremacy of the small self. Each of us conceives 
himself to be an exclusive unit, an ego sharply marked off 
from whatever lies outside his physical body and mental 
history. From this egoism springs all that is morally bad. 
We should realise in our life and conduct that all things 
are in God and of God. The man who knows this truth 
will long to lose his life, will hate all selfish goods and sell 
all that he has, would wish even to be despised and rejected 
of the world, if so he can come into accord with the universal 
life of God. In one sense the Upanisad morality is in- 
dividualistic, for its aim is self-realisation ; but “ individual- 
istic ” ceases here to have any exclusive meaning. To 
realise oneself is to identify oneself with a good that is not 
his alone. Moral life is a God-centred life, a life of passionate 
love and enthusiasm for humanity, of seeking the infinite 
through the finite, and not a mere selfish adventure for 
small ends.* 

Finite objects cannot give us the satisfaction for which 
aur soul hungers. As in the field of intellect we miss the 
ultimate reality in the objects of the empirical world, even 

! International Journal of Ethics, 1914, pp. 171-*. * l£a Upanisad, 1. 



PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 213 


so the absolute good we seek for in morality is not to be 
found in finite satisfactions. “ The infinite is bliss, there 
is no bliss in things finite." 1 Yajnavalkya, leaving for 
the forest, proposed to divide his property between his 
two wives, Maitreyi and Katyayanl. Maitreyi did not 
know what to do ; sitting among her household possessions, 
rather sadly she was looking outwards towards the forest. 
That day she administered a rebuke to the petty man who 
pursues worthless aims in such breathless haste. Finite 
things produce the opposite of what we aim at through 
them. The spirit in us craves for true satisfaction, and 
nothing less than the infinite can give us that. We seek 
finite objects, we get them, but there is no satisfaction 
in them. We may conquer the whole world, and yet we 
sigh that there are no more worlds to conquer. " What- 
ever he reaches he wishes to go beyond. If he reaches the 
sky, he wishes to go beyond.” a Most of us are on " the 
road that leads to wealth in which many men perish.” s 
By becoming slaves to things, by swathing ourselves in 
external possessions, we miss the true self. "No man 
can be made happy by wealth.” “ The hereafter never 
rises before the eyes of the careless youth, befooled by the 
delusion of wealth. ‘ This is the world,’ he thinks ; * there 
is no other.’ Thus he falls again and again into the 
power of death.” 4 " Wise men, knowing the nature of what 

is immortal, do not look for anything stable here among 
things unstable.” 5 Man is in anguish when he is separated 
from God, and nothing else than union with God can satisfy 
his heart’s hunger. 6 The unbounded aspirations of the 
soul for the ideally beautiful, the specklessly pure, are not 
answered by the objects limited in space, time and the 
shackles of sense. Many men there are who wish to realise 
the ideal of an absolutely worthy existence in love of another 
being. So long as that being is another human self, localised 
in space and time, the ideal is never attained. It is self- 
deception to seek the fullness of love and beauty in another

human being, man or woman. The perfect realisation 
can only be in the Eternal. Detachment from the world 
and its possessions is necessary for this. From the beginning 
there were people who sought deliverance from sorrow in 
retirement from the world. Many there were who left 
wife and child, goods and chattels, and went out as mendi- 
cants, seeking the salvation of the souls in poverty and 
purity of life. These groups of ascetics, who burst the 
bonds that bound them to a home life, prepared the way 
for the monasticism of the Buddhists. A life of holy re- 
nunciation has been recognised to be the chief path to 
deliverance. 

It follows that the Upanisads insist on the inwardness 
of morality and attach great importance to the motive in 
conduct. Inner purity is more important than outer con- 
formity. Not only do the Upanisads say “ do not steal,” 
" do not murder,” but they also declare “ do not covet,” 
or ‘‘do not hate or yield to anger, malice and greed.” The 
mind will have to be purified, for it is no use cutting the 
branches if one leaves the roots intact. Conduct is judged 
by its subjective worth or the degree of sacrifice involved. 

The Upanisads require us to look upon the whole world 
as born of God as the self of man is. If insistence on this 
doctrine is interpreted as reducing all love finally to a well- 
directed egoism, the Upanisads admit that morality and 
love are forms of the highest self-realisation, but only object 
to the word "egoism” with all its associations. Yajna- 
valkya maintains that self-love lies at the foundation of 
all other kinds of love. Love of wealth and property, clan 
and country are special forms of self-love. The love of 
the finite has only instrumental value, while love of the 
eternal has intrinsic worth. " The son is dear for the sake 
of the eternal in him.” Finite objects help us to realise 
the self. Only the love of the Eternal is supreme love, 
which is its own reward, for God is love . 1 To love God 
is bliss ; not to love Him is misery. To love God is to 
possess knowledge and immortality ; not to love Him is 
to be lost in doubt and delusion, sorrow and death . 2 In 
all true religion it is the same dominating motive that

PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 215 


we have. “ He that sinneth against me wrongeth his own 
soul. All they that hate me love death.” 1 The sinners 
are the slayers of their souls, according to the Upanisads 
“atmahano janah.” 

The Upanisads ask us to renounce selfish endeavours, 
but not all interests. Detachment from self and attachment 
to God are what the Upanisads demand. The ideal sage 
has desires, though they are not selfish desires. “ He who 
has no desires, who is beyond desires, whose desires are 
satisfied, whose desire is the soul, being even Brahman 
obtains Brahman.” 1 Kama, which we are asked to re- 
nounce, is not desire as such, but only the animal desire, 
lust, the impulsive craving of the brute man. Freedom 
from kama is enjoined, but this is not blank passivity. We 
are asked to free ourselves from the tyranny of lust and 
greed, from the fascination of outward things, from the 
fulfilment of instinctive cravings.3 Desire as such is not 
forbidden. It all depends upon the object. If a man’s 
desire is the flesh, he becomes an adulterer ; if things of 
beauty, an artist ; if God, a saint. The desires for salvation 
and knowledge are highly commended. A distinction is 
drawn between true desires and false ones,4 and we are 
asked to share in the true ones. The filial piety and affection 
of a Naciketas, the intense love and devotion of a Savitri 
are not faults. The Lord of all creation has kama in the 
sense of desire. “ He desired (akamayata), let me become 
many.” If the Lord has desires, why should not we ? We 
do not find in the Upanisads any sweeping condemnation 
of affections. We are asked to root out pride, resentment, 
lust, etc., and not the tender feelings of love, compassion 
and sympathy. It is true that here and there the Upanisads 
speak of tapas as a means of spiritual realisation. But 
tapas only means the development of soul force, the freeing 
of the soul from slavery to body, severe thinking or energising 
of mind, “ whose tapas consists of thought itself.” 5 Life is 
a great festival to which we are invited, that we might show

tapas or self-renunciation, dana or liberality, arjavam or 
right dealing, ahimsa or non-injury to life, and satyava- 
canam or truthfulness. 1 * * 4 It is the spirit of disinterested- 
ness that is conveyed by tapas or tyaga. “ Not by karma, 
not by offspring, not by wealth, but by renunciation can 
immortality be gained.” 1 The Chandogya Upanisad says 
“ sraddha tapah.” 3 Faith is asceticism. To realise freedom 
from the bondage of outward things one need not go to 
the solitude of the forest and increase his privations and 
penances that so the last remnants of earthly dependence 
might be thrown away. “ By renunciation thou shouldst 
enjoy,” says the Isa Upanisad. We can enjoy the world 
if we are not burdened by the bane of worldly possessions ; 
we are princes in the world if we do not harbour any thought 
of covetousness. Our enjoyment of the world is in direct 
proportion to our poverty. A call to renunciation in the 
sense of killing out the sense of separateness and developing 
disinterested love is the essence of all true religion.-! 

There was a change in Indian thought after the Vedic 
period. 5 Due to the asceticism of the Atharva-Veda, the 
mystic tendency increased. During the period of the hymns 
of the Rg-Veda there was a sort of selfish abandonment 
to pleasure. The spiritual instinct of the human soul 
asserted itself, and in the period of the Upanisads the 
protest against the tyranny of the senses was heard in 
clear tones. No more is the spirit to follow helpless and 
miserable the flesh that rages and riots. But this spirit 
of renunciation did not degenerate in the Upanisads into 
the insane asceticism of a later day, which revelled in the 
burning of bodies and such other practices. In the manner 
of Buddha, Bharadvaja protests against both worldly life 
and asceticism. 6 We may even say that this measureless 
and fanatical asceticism is not indicative of a true renuncia- 
tion, but is only another form of selfishness. Attempts to

gain solitary salvation embodying the view that one’s soul 
is more precious than all the world’s souls put together 
are not the expression of any genuine modesty of spirit. 
The Upanisads require us to work but disinterestedly. 
The righteous man is not he who leaves the world and 
retires to a cloister, but he who lives in the world and loves 
the objects of the world, not for their own sake, but for 
the sake of the infinite they contain, the universal they 
conceal. To him God has unconditional value, and all 
objects possess derived values as vehicles of the whole 
or as the ways to God. Every common duty fulfilled, every 
individual sacrifice made, helps the realisation of the self. 
We may be fathers, for that is a way of transcending our 
narrow individuality and identifying ourselves with the 
larger purposes. Human love is a shadow of the divine 
love. We may love our wives for the sake of the joy that 
burns at the heart of things. “ In truth, not for the hus- 
band’s sake is the husband dear, but for the sake of the 
Atman is the husband dear,” says the Upanisad. The 
same is asserted with constant repetition of wife, sons, 
kingdoms, the Brahmin and the warrior castes, world 
regions, gods, living creations and the universe. They are 
all here, not on their own account, but for the sake of the 
Eternal . 1 The objects of the world are represented not as 
lures to sin, but as pathways to the divine bliss. When 
once we have the right vision, we may have wealth, etc . 2 
" Tato me iriyam avaha.” “ After that bring me wealth.” 
And Samkara points out that wealth is an evil to the unre- 
generate, but not to the man of wisdom. Things of the 
world seemingly undivine are a perpetual challenge to the 
spiritual soul. He has to combat their independence and 
turn them into expressions of the divine. He does all 
work in this spirit of detachment. "To be detached is 
to be loosened from every tie which binds a soul to the 
earth, to be dependent on nothing sublunary, to lean on 
nothing temporal. It is to care nothing what other men 
choose to say or think of us or do ; to go about our work 
as soldiers go to battle, without a care for the consequences, 
to account credit, honour, name, easy circumstances, com-

fort, human affection, just nothing at all when any religious 
obligation requires sacrifice of them.” 1 The Upanisads 
demand a sort of physical preparation for the spiritual 
fight. Cleansing, fasting, continence, solitude, etc., as 
purificatory of the body, are enjoined. “ May my body 
become fit, may my tongue become extremely sweet, may 
I hear much in my ears.” 1 This is not to despise the body 
as a clog and an encumbrance to the human soul. Nor 
has this purifying of the body, freeing of the senses, develop- 
ment of the mind, anything in common with self-torture.3 
Again, in the Chandogya Upanisadt we are told that the world 
of Brahman belongs to those who find it by brahmacarya. 
Brahmacarya is the discipline a student has to undergo 
when studying under a guru. It is not an ascetic with- 
drawal from the world, for the same Upanisad in viii. 5 
makes brahmacarya equivalent to the performing of sacrifices. 
It looks as if these were meant as a warning against the 
false interpretation of brahmacarya as aloofness from the 
world. The body is the servant of the soul and not its 
prison. There is no indication in the Upanisads that we 
must give up life, mind, consciousness, intelligence, etc. On 
the other hand, the doctrine of divine immanence leads to 
an opposite conclusion. 

“ The Indian sages, as the Upanisads speak of them,” 
according to Gough, “ seek for participation in divine life, 
not by pure feeling, high thought, and strenuous endeavour, 
not by unceasing effort to learn the true and do the right, 
but by the crushing out of every feeling and every thought, 
by vacuity, apathy, inertion and ecstasy.” 5 The aim of 
the Upanisads, according to Eucken, is “ not so much a 
penetration and overcoming of the world as a separation 
and liberation from it ; not an enhancement of life in order 
to maintain it even in face of the hardest resistance, but 
an abatement, a softening of all hardness, a dissolution, 
a fading away, a profound contemplation .” 6 The view 

1 Newman : University Sketches, p. 127. 1 Tait., i. 4. 

J Gough makes a mistake by translating tapas into self-torture. In 
Tait. i. 4 the injunctions are to the effect that the body must be rendered 
fit for the habitation of God.

here stated that the Upanisads demand a release from 
the conditions which constitute human life is a complete 
misconception. The Upanisads do not ask us to renounce 
life, do not taboo desires as such. The essence of ethical 
life is not the sublation of the will. The false asceticism 
which regards life as a dream and the world as an illusion, 
which has obsessed some thinkers in India as well as in 
Europe, is foreign to the prevailing tone of the Upanisads. 
A healthy joy in the life of the world pervades the atmo- 
sphere. To retire from the world is to despair of humanity 
and confess the discomfiture of God. “ Only performing 
works one should desire to live a hundred years.” 1 There 
is no call to forsake the world, but only to give up the dream 
of its separate reality. We are asked to pierce behind the 
veil, realise the presence of God in the world of nature and 
society. We are to renounce the world in its immediacy, 
break with its outward appearance, but redeem it for God 
and make it express the divinity within us and within it. 
The Upanisad conception of the world is a direct challenge 
to the spiritual activity of man. A philosophy of resignation, 
an ascetic code of ethics, and a temper of languid world- 
weariness are an insult to the Creator of the universe, a sin 
against ourselves and the world which has a claim on us. 
The Upanisads believe in God, and so believe in the world 
as well. 

The Upanisads do not content themselves with merely 
emphasising the spirit of true religion. They also give us 
a code of duties, without which the moral ideal will be an 
uncertain guide. All forms of conduct where passion is 
controlled and reason reigns supreme, where there is self- 
transcendence in the sense of freedom from the narrowness 
of selfish individuality, where we work because we are all 
co-operators in the divine scheme, are virtuous, and their 
opposites vicious. Restraint, liberality and mercy are 
virtues. 3 The principle that the left hand should not know 
what the right hand does is expressed in the following 
words : “ Give with faith, give not without faith give in 
plenty, give with bashfulness, give with fear, give with 
sympathy.” 3 In Chandogya (iii. 17) meditation, charity

right dealing, non-injury to life and truthfulness are laid 
down as right forms of conduct. 1 To shrink from torturing 
the brute creation, to be sorry for a hunted hare, may be, 
according to our modern notions, silly sentimentalism fit 
only for squeamish women. But in the Upanisads love 
of brute creation is considered to be a great virtue. Kind- 
ness and compassion for all that has life on earth is a general 
feature of Indian ethics. It is a crime to kill a deer for 
sport or worry a rat for amusement. To attain conquest 
over passions, a discipline is sometimes enjoined. The 
Indian thinkers believe in the dependence of mind on body, 
and so prescribe purity of food as necessary for the purity 
of mind. 1 Control over the passions must be spontaneous, 
and when that is not possible forcible restraint is sometimes 
adopted. A distinction is made between tapas, or forcible 
constraint of passions, and nyasa, or spiritual renunciation. 
Tapas is for the vanaprastha who is in the lower stage, 
while nyasa is for the sannyasin. The yogic practices of 
concentration, contemplation, etc., are to be met with. 
“ The wise should sink speech in the mind and the mind 
into buddhi.” 3 Meditation and concentration as means 
of cleansing the mind are also enjoined. The individual 
is asked to turn all his thoughts inward and think only 
of God, not with an eye to obtaining favours, but to becoming 
one with Him. But even this exaltation of contemplative 
life is not necessarily an escape from reality. It is only 
the means by which we can see the ultimate truth of things.

asramas of the brahmacarin or student, grhastha or house- 
holder, vanaprastha or anchorite, and sannyasi or wandering 
mendicant, are mentioned as representing the different steps 
by which man gradually purifies himself from all earthly 
taint and becomes fit for his spiritual home. 

Retirement from the world is enjoined for every Aryan 
when once his duties to society are fulfilled. It comes at 
the end of a man’s career. The ascetic wanderer, whose life 
is love and conduct righteousness, turns his eyes towards 
heaven and keeps himself free from the temptations of the

world. The simple but devout minds of India were haunted 
by dreams of imperishable beauty and echoes of unceasing 
music. They live so intimately with the ideal that they 
are persuaded of its reality. To us it may be a dream, 
yet it is a dream in which they live, and it is therefore more 
real than the reality they ignore. A severe training of 
body and soul is prescribed for the ascetic, who alone can 
live such an ideal life. His life must be governed by the 
strictest purity and poverty. He is required to wear the 
yellow garments, shave his head and beg for his food in 
the streets. These are the means to help the soul to humility. 
The soul can mount to everlasting bliss by means of care- 
fully regulated prayers and fastings. What makes an 
ascetic great is his holiness and humility. It is not the 
capacity to do clever conjurer's tricks or dream hysteric 
dreams, but it is to remain pure from lust and resentment, 
passion and desire. This living martyrdom is ever so much 
more difficult than killing oneself. Death is easy. It is 
life that is taxing. A true ascetic is not one who gives 
up home and society to escape the social bonds ; he is not 
one who becomes a sannyasin because he suffers shipwreck 
in life. It is these latter that draw disgrace on the whole 
institution. The true sannyasin is he who, with self-control 
and spiritual vision, suffers for mankind. The labour of 
life is laid upon us to purify us from egoism, and social 
institutions are devices to help the growth of the soul. So 
after the grhasthasrama, or the stage of the householder, 
comes that of the recluse. The Upanisads declare that 
the knowers of Atman relinquish all selfish interests and 
become mendicants. “ Knowing Him, the Atman, Brahmins 
relinquish the desire for posterity, the desire for possessions, 
the desire for worldly prosperity, and go forth as mendicants .” 1 
In Ancient India, though the sannyasin is poor and penni- 


1 According to Oldenberg, this is the earliest trace of Indian monas- 
ticism. " From these Brahmins, who knowing the Atman renounce all that 
is earthly, and become beggars, the historical development progresses in 
a regular line up to Buddha, who leaves kith and kin, and goods and chattels, 
to seek deliverance, wandering homeless in the yellow garb of monk. • The 
appearance of the doctrine of the Eternal One and the origin of monastic 
life in India are simultaneous ; they are the two issues of the same important 
occurrence ” (Oldenberg : Buddha, p. 32).

less, lives on daily charity, and has no power or authority 
of any kind, he is still held in such high esteem that the 
emperors of the world bow to him. Such is the reverence 
for holy life. 

The asramadharma, one of the central features of the 
Hindu religion, attempts to fill the whole of life with the 
power of spirit. It insists that a life of rigorous chastity is 
the proper preparation for married life. To the thinkers of 
the Upanisads, marriage is a religious sacrament, a form 
of divine service . 1 The home is sacred, and no religious 
ceremony is complete without the wife taking part in it. 
After the individual realises to the full the warmth and 
glow of human love and family affection, through marriage 
and parenthood, he is called upon to free himself slowly 
from attachment to home and family in order that he might 
realise his dignity as a citizen of the universe. If Buddhism 
failed to secure a permanent hold on the mind of India, 
it was because it exalted the ideal of celibacy over that 
of marriage and allowed all to enter the highest order of 
sannyasins, regardless of their previous preparation for it. 
The sannyasins are a spiritual brotherhood without possessions, 
without caste and nationality, enjoined to preach in the 
spirit of joy the gospel of love and service. They are the 
ambassadors of God on earth, witnessing to the beauty 
of holiness, the power of humility, the joy of poverty and 
the freedom of service. 

The rules of caste prescribe the duties to society. Man 
has to fulfil his duties whatever his lot may be. The 
functions depend on the capacities. Brahminhood does not 
depend on birth, but on character. The following story 
reveals this truth : 

Satyakama, the son of Jabala, addressed his mother and said: 
“ I wish to become a brahma :ann, mother. Of what family am I ? ” 

She said to him : “ I do not know, my child, of what family thou 
art. In my youth, when I had to move about much as a servant, 
I conceived thee. So I do not know of what family thou art. I 
am Jabala. by name. Thou art Satyakama. Say that thou art 
Satyakama Jabala.” 

He going to Gautama, the son of Haridrumat, said to him : " I 
wish to become a brahniacarin with thee. Sire. May 1 come to you ? ' 


1 See Tait. Up., i. 



PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 223 

He said to him : “ Of what family art thou, my friend ? " 

He replied : “ I do not know. Sire, of what family I am. I asked 
my mother, and she answered : ' In my youth, when I had to move 
about much as a servant, I conceived thee. I do not know of what 
family thou art. I am Jabala by name, thou art Satyakama.’ I am 
therefore Satyakama Jabala, Sire.” 

He said to him : ” No one but a true Brahmin would thus speak 
out. Go and fetch fuel, I shall initiate thee. Thou hast not swerved 
from the truth.” 1 

The whole philosophy of the Upanisads tends towards 
the softening of the divisions and the undermining of class 
hatreds and antipathies. God is the inner soul of all alike. 
So all must be capable of responding to the truth and 
therefore possess a right to be taught the truth. Sanat- 
kumara, the representative of the Ksatriyas, instructs the 
Brahmin Narada about the ultimate mystery of things. 
Higher philosophy and religion were by no means confined 
to the Brahmin class. We read of kings instructing the 
famous teachers of the time about the deep problems of 
spirit. Janaka and Ajatasatru are Ksatriya kings who 
held religious congresses where philosophical disputations 
were conducted. It was a period of keen intellectual life. 
Even ordinary people were interested in the problems of 
philosophy. Wise men are found wandering up and down 
the country eager to debate. The Brahmin editors of the 
Upanisads had so sincere a regard for truth that they 
were ready to admit that Ksatriyas took an important 
part in these investigations . 1 Women, though they were 
much sheltered so far as the struggle for life was concerned, 
had equal rights with men in the spiritual struggle for 
salvation. Maitreyi, GargI discuss the deep problems of 
spirit and enter into philosophic tournaments.3 

It is true that the Upanisads lay stress on knowledge 
as the means to salvation. " Tarati Sokam atmavit,” the 
knower of Atman, crosses all sorrow. “ Brahmavid Brah- 
maiva bhavati,” the knower of Brahman, becomes indeed 
Brahman. Because the Upanisads lay stress on jnana, 
and look upon all morality as a preliminary to it, there are

224 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

critics who contend that the Upanisads in their enthusiasm 
for jnana relegate the will to a subordinate place. Deussen, 
after urging that morality has no meaning for the enlight- 
ened, says that it is not necessary even for the unenlightened. 
“ Moral conduct cannot contribute directly but only in- 
directly to the attainment of the knowledge that brings 
emancipation. For this knowledge is not a becoming 
something which had no previous existence and might be 
brought about by appropriate moans, but it is the per- 
ception of that which previously existed from all eternity.” 1 
But the Upanisads do not advocate knowledge in the 
narrow sense of the term as the sole means to salvation. 
“ That self cannot be gained by the knowledge of the Veda 
or by understanding or by much learning.” 3 Right living 
is also insisted on. Knowledge should be accompanied by 
virtue. If the candidate for theology does not possess 
moral and spiritual attainments, he is not admitted, what- 
ever be his zeal and inquisitiveness.3 Jnana, we must 
make it clear, is not mere intellectual ability. It is the 
soul-sense. The mind of the applicant must not be too 
restless or too much taken up with the world to fix itself 
on the Highest. His heart must be purified and warmed 
by devotion to God. We hear in the Upanisads of people 
who are required to go through a long course of moral and 
spiritual discipline before they are taken up as students 
by those rsis, the specialists in the science of God. In 
the Prasna Upanisad, Pippalada sends away six inquirers 
after God for another year of discipline. In the Chandogya 
Upanisad, Satyakama Jabala is sent to the wilds of the 
forests to tend the teacher’s cattle, that thereby he might 
cultivate habits of solitary reflection and come into contact 
with nature. The jnana which the Upanisads emphasise 
is the faith which becomes the living law of the soul’s energy. 
As the tree bears fruit, knowledge must realise itself in work. 
When we have jnana we are said to possess truth, make it 
our own and be transformed by it. This is not possible 
for " one who has not ceased from wicked conduct, who

is not calm, who is not collected and in whose heart there 
is not peace.” Ramanuja therefore interprets knowledge to 
be dhyana, meditation, or upasana, worship. ' There does 
not seem to be any justification for the interpretation that 
excludes moral life from knowledge. It is true that the 
Upanisads urge that mere works will not do, unless these 
express the feeling of unity with the self. “ Nay, even if 
one who does not know that self should perform here some 
great holy work, it will perish for him in the end. If the 
man worships the self only as his true spirit, his work does 
not perish. For whatever he desires, that he obtains from 
this self.” 1 This passage insists that works must be per- 
formed with knowledge. Without faith in the transcendent 
mere works languish . 1 The real end of man cannot be 
reached by mere mechanical goodness. In all works, in 
offering sacrifices, in observing ritual, there is self-trans- 
cendence, but not necessarily identification with the infinite. 
All works must be done with the definite motive of promoting 
the interest of the real self. Without God our life has no 
aim, no existence and no support. The Upanisads con- 
demn the rites and sacrifices performed with the sole idea 
of bringing about large returns of outward good either in 
this world or in the next. We should not do our duty 
with the motive of purchasing shares in the other world 
or opening a bank account with God. In protesting against 
such a mechanical conception of duty in the Brahmanas, 
the Upanisads lay stress on a necessary truth. But they 
lend no support to the view that works and knowledge 
are exclusive of each other, and that knowledge alone leads 
to salvation. The Upanisads insist on a life of spirit 
which combines both jnana and karma. 

Just as the ideal of the intellect cannot be realised so 
long as we remain at the intellectual level, but can be found 
when we transcend that level, and rise to intuition, even 
so the ideal of morality cannot be reached so long as we 
remain at the moral level, but can be reached when we rise 
to religion. At the moral level the two sides of our nature, 
the finite and the infinite, are in conflict. The finite breathes 
egoism or ahamkara, and gives the individual a sense of 
* Brh., i. 4.15. • See Brh., iii. 8. 10. 



226 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

his separateness from the universal. The infinite in him 
rushes forth to realise itself in the world. The self-fulfilment 
of spirit is opposed by the tendency to the disintegration 
of spirit. We attempt to hold the lower nature in check 
through the practice of morality, but until the lower is 
completely spiritualised the ideal is not attained. It is 
when we destroy the exclusiveness of our individuality 
and therewith the sense of separateness that we enter the 
joy of religion and realise the full freedom of the spirit. 

The possibility of this religious realisation is the pre- 
supposition of all morality. Without it we cannot be sure 
that the aspirations of morality will be realised. In the 
face of disasters and dreads, death and disease, the con- 
viction that in spite of the apparent discord and contra- 
diction all things work together for good, cheers us. Morality 
requires the postulate of religion. God gives us the security 
that all is well with the world and man is bound to 
win. “ When a man finds his peace and resting-place in 
that invisible, intangible, inexpressible, unfathomable, 
then has he attained to peace. If, however, a man admits 
therein an interval, a separation, then his unrest continues ; 
it is, moreover, the unrest of one who imagines himself 
wise .” 1 With this religious guarantee the pressure of cir- 
cumstance or the persecution of man fails to disquiet us. 
No rivalry provokes us to anger or bitterness. Religion 
is the inspiration of morality. Without religion morality 
becomes an eternal striving, a perpetual progress, an endless 
aspiration towards something we do not have. In religion 
all this is turned into realisation, enjoyment and fruition. 
Then is the weakness of finite endowment overcome, and the 
finite self becomes endowed with a meaning and a mission. 
When once this consciousness is reached the continuance 
or the cessation of bodily existence becomes a matter of 
indifference . 2 Man is consumed with the fire of the love 
of God and the service of humanity. He does not care

PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 227 


whether the path he has to traverse is smooth or rough. 
When a man realises the truth, evil turns away from him 
and is itself destroyed, just as a ball of earth hitting against 
a solid stone. 1 

As the intuitional level goes beyond the categories of 
intellect, even so does the religious level pass beyond the 
distinctions of good and evil. He who reaches the highest 
is above all laws.* “ Him does not afflict the thought, 
why have I not done what is good, why have I committed 
sin ? ” 3 He fears nothing and does not trouble himself 
about his deeds and misdeeds in the past. “ He the im- 
mortal is beyond both, beyond good and evil ; what is 
done and what is left undone cause him no pain, his domain 
is affected by no action.” This admits the possibility of 
blotting out the effects of a sinful life by a sincere change 
of heart. On this principle is based the Christian doctrine 
that no amount of sin is a bar to salvation, provided an 
act of sure repentance has been performed. When once 
the soul attains the real, “ in whom to dwell is happiness 
imperishable,” the human body is suffused with the splen- 
dour of divinity in which all that is mean and vile shrivels 
and dies. The question of morality has no significance. 
For it is no more the individual that does anything. His 
will is God’s will and his life God’s life. He has joined the 
whole, and thus become the whole. All action flows from 
the spring in God. There is no more the distinction between 
God and the individual. Dr. Bosanquet, in his excellent 
little book on What Religion Is, brings out this fundamental 
oneness of the highest condition. “ In the purity of love 
and will with the supreme good, you are not only ‘ saved,’ 
but you are ‘ free ’ and ‘ strong.’ . . . You will not be 
helped by trying to divide up the unity and tell how much 
comes from ‘ you ’ and how much from ‘ God.’ You have 
got to deepen yourself in it, or let it deepen itself in you, 
whatever phrase expresses the fact best to your mind.” 4

Unfortunately, this central truth of religious life is not 
sufficiently understood by even some good students of 
Indian thought. The latest critic of the Upanisads, Dr. 
Hume, observes : " There is a wide difference between the 
Upani?adic theory and the theory of the Greek sages, 
that the man who has knowledge should thereby become 
virtuous in character, or that the result of teaching should 
be a virtuous life. Here the possession of some metaphysical 
knowledge actually cancels all past sins and even permits 
the knower unblushingly to continue in ‘ what seems to 
be much evil ’ with perfect impunity, although such acts 
are heinous crimes and are disastrous in their effect for 
others who lack that kind of knowledge.” 1 We have 
already said that the knowledge of the Upanisads is not 
metaphysical acumen or dialectical subtlety, but the reali- 
sation of the highest as the supreme power at the heart 
of the universe. This spiritual perception is possible only 
with a thorough transformation of human nature in its 
theoretical and practical aspects. What Dr. Hume calls 
" the possession of some metaphysical knowledge ” is pos- 
sible only for the pure in heart. They have perfect freedom. 
" In that highest state a thief is not a thief, a murderer 
not a murderer. He is not followed by good, nor followed 
by evil, for he then overcomes all the sorrows of the heart.” ’ 
The free can do what they choose with perfect impunity, 
but this freedom is not ‘‘the madness of license.” 3 The 
mystic becomes a law unto himself and the lord of 
himself and of the world in which he lives. Laws and 
regulations are necessary for those men who do not naturally 
conform to the dictates of conscience. But for those who 
have risen above their selfish egos, morality becomes the 
very condition of their being, and law is fulfilled in love. 
There is no possibility of evil-doing in them. Pressure 

same light, so that it seems not illumined but itself the light, thus in the 
saints every human affection must in ineffable mode be liquefied of itself 
and transfused into the Will of God. How could God be all, if in man any- 
thing of man remained ? A certain substance will remain, but in another 
form, another glory, another power ” (St. Bernard, quoted in Mind, 1913, 
P- 329)-

fro without is converted into an inward acceptance. Till 
the spiritual life is won, the law of morality appears to 
be an external command which man has to obey with effort 
and pain. But when the light is obtained it becomes the 
internal life of the spirit, working itself out unconsciously 
and spontaneously. The saint’s action is an absolute sur- 
render to the spontaneity of spirit, and is not an unwilling 
obedience to externally imposed laws. We have the free 
outpouring of an unselfish spirit which does not calculate 
the rewards of action or the penalties of omission. The 
conventional standards, the external duties and the ethical 
rules become meaningless to him. The soul delights in 
that supreme blessedness, perceives the unity of all, and 
loves the world as we love our separate selves. “ A per- 
fectly good will would therefore be equally subject to objective 
laws (viz. laws of good), but could not be conceived as 
obliged thereby to act lawfully, because of itself from its 
subjective constitution it can only be determined by the 
conception of good. Therefore no imperatives hold for the 
Divine will or in general for a holy will ; ought is here out 
of place, because volition is already of itself necessarily 
in unison with the law.” 1 The moral laws are its expression, 
and therefore do not bind it. Such a supreme soul is the 
creator of values and svarat, 1 a law to himself. In the 
scheme of the world we have three classes of beings : 
(x) Those who strive after self-assertion and gratification of 
appetites, the bad men who, if ever they practise virtue, 
do so for selfish reasons, such as hope of heaven or fear of 
hell ; (2) men who know the law and try to conform to 
it with great effort and trouble, since their selves are subject 
to discord ; and (3) the saviours of the world, who have 
overcome the conflict of life and attained peace. They know 
the purpose of life and live up to it unconsciously and auto- 
matically. The Upanisad asks us in cases of doubt and 
difficulty to conduct ourselves in the manner in which the 
knowers of Brahman devoted to duty would do. 3 These 
great men go on doing their daily work, diffusing virtue 
as the star diffuses light and the flower perfume, without

INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 


even being aware of it. Every man can realise such a 
condition. The possibility of becoming one with God can 
be established only by the actuality of it. The fact of 
realisation is the only proof of the possibility of the identi- 
fication of man with the all-powerful spirit. According 
to Christian thinkers, one such complete manifestation of 
God in man is in the personality of Jesus. The Upanisads 
declare that all men have in them the possibility of rising 
to their full divine stature, and can realise it if they strive 
for it. 

Since morality has a meaning only in the imperfect 
world where man is struggling to realise his highest nature, 
it is sometimes said that in the metaphysical system of 
the Upanisads morality does not find a worthy place. 
Deussen observes that when “ the knowledge of the Atman 
has been gained, every action and therefore every moral 
action also has been deprived of meaning.” 1 All through 
we have been indicating the basis of such complaints. Moral 
activity is not an end in itself. It is to be taken over into 
the perfect life. Only this has transcendental worth. The 
liberated in the fine phrase of the Talmud share with the 
Almighty in the work of creation. Here we have morality 
as obedience to a law displaced by the true idea of free 
service of an end, spontaneous devotion to the whole. In 
this state the individual being is absorbed in the Supreme. 
This alone has transcendental worth, but the moral struggle 
as preparing the way for it is not useless.

The Religious Consciousness 

Religion is essentially a matter of life and experience. 
The Upanisads prescribe three stages in the growth of the 
religious consciousness, viz. sravana, which literally means 
listening, manana or reflection, and nididhyasana or con- 
templative meditation . 2 The first stage points to the place

verse which mentions agama or scripture, anumana or inference, and dhyana 
or meditation. 



PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 231 


of tradition in religious life For the initiation of faith 
in the living God, some kind of traditional revelation is 
necessary. “ Blessed are they that have not seen and 
yet have believed.” The bulk of men rest with tradition 
and symbol. Religion, according to the Upanisads, is not, 
however, to be confused with traditionalism. By strenuous 
intellectual effort, we should try to understand the essential 
meaning of or the truth contained in the tradition. The 
need for rational thought is brought out in the second stage. 
The mere assumption of the first stage becomes now a logical 
conclusion. The understanding of truth, however, is not 
the attainment of reality. To the highest religious con- 
sciousness, the real is not something inferred, but given. 
This experience of reality, this consciousness of the infinite, 
requires the development of a mode of apprehension distinct 
from that of mere reason. Nididhyasana, or contemplative 
meditation, helps us to transform the logical idea into a 
spiritual perception, or dariana, which is another name 
for the effective realisation of truth already admitted. It 
is to stand alone, and like Whitman, after a logical study 
of astronomy, “ to gaze in perfect silence at the stars.” 
It is to hold before the mind’s eye the object we seek to 
know. Meditation is not advised as a means to trance and 
catalepsy, which are most emphatically denounced, but only 
as a help for the mind to rest on the object. By suppressing 
all fluctuations of thought and the distractions of desire, 
we allow the mind to settle on the object, penetrate it and 
become one with it. The worship of God, the practice of good- 
ness and the pursuit of truth are aids to the building up 
of the life of truth in the soul. While the speculative mind 
contemplates the being of God, the emotional nature in its 
passionate devotion for God loses itself in Him. The object 
is no more outside us as in ordinary experience. There is 
an intense realisation, which pulses through the whole 
being, a becoming one with God as it were. The worshipper 
grows akin to that which he worships. The object becomes 
not only the content of but the consciousness itself of the 
contemplator. The transformation of mind is in a sense 
the transformation of existence itself. The Upanisads 
speak to us of the intuition of minor deities as well as the 



232 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

ecstatic intuition of Brahman. So long as the objects 
intuited have limitations or traces of individuality, the ulti- 
mate goal is not reached. We must intuit Brahman to 
become Brahman. 

It is clear that the religion of the Upanisads insists on 
a transformation of the whole nature of man. It is not 
a mere formal cult or an ethical discipline or a dogmatic 
creed. It is untrue to say that the Upanisads do not care 
for the non-intellectual sides of human nature. They pro- 
vide room for an emotional as well as a speculative religion. 
The Upanisads are aware of the contradictions which 
ordinary religious consciousness is apt to exhibit. If 
God is perfect goodness, then morality is already 
realised, for everything that is must be the expression 
of a perfect will. If God is the Creator of the world, 
then He must bring something into existence which 
limits His nature. Either the world created is distinct 
from God the Creator, in which case He is limited by His 
creation, or the two are identical, a possibility which is 
repugnant to all religion and morality. In religion we 
have the will of man set over against the will of God. If 
the two are one, then there is no morality, for there is no 
independent reality of the human will. If the two are 
different, then God becomes limited and finite, and a finite 
God cannot inspire confidence in us. Again, if we attribute 
to God a free will, then He can overrule karma, and caprice 
will become the central fact ; if on the other hand He is 
subject to laws and treats us according to our karma, then 
His freedom is restricted. These contradictions may lead 
us to think that the highest conception of God we can 
possibly have is not the highest reality. Religion may 
lag behind and have to be content with a finite God, how- 
ever contradictory such a conception may be. This may 
be justified on the ground that it is not its main business 
to discover the highest truth, and that philosophically we 
may have to admit that all conceptions of God, however 
lofty they may be, are only relative . 1 While this may 
be the implication of the Upanisad theory, it becomes an 
explicit doctrine only when the intuitive vision of the 
* See Kena, i. 5. 8. 



PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 233 

Upanisads is converted into a scientific system of thought. 
The Upanisads, indeed, recognise higher and lower forms 
of religion. 

We have to remember that the highest religion of the 
Upanisads, which insists on meditation and morality and 
worship of God in spirit and in truth, is not encumbered 
by such traditional dogmas and miracles as still hang upon 
the skirts of other religions. Its central principle that 
there is one supreme reality that manifests itself in the 
universe is not asserted as a dogma. It is the ultimate 
truth at which it is possible for human understanding to 
arrive. The progress of science and philosophy does not 
conflict with it but only confirms it. The Upanisad re- 
ligion is the feeling of reverence and love for the great spirit. 
Such meditation is spiritualised bhakti. It recognises also 
that the distinction between subject and object melts away 
in the heart of religious fervour. The oneness and whole- 
ness of the world is the supreme fact of the Upanisad religion. 
This may not satisfy the ordinary religious consciousness. 
Man as finite self is incapable of grasping the absolute 
reality. He makes an object of it set over against himself. 
The Absolute becomes a personal God. Though it is not 
the final truth, ordinary religious consciousness requires it. 
God is the friend and helper, the father and creator, the 
governor of the universe. He is said to be the supreme 
person (Purusottama), but He does not rule the world from 
without. In that case there would be no organic connection 
between Him and the world. He is the inner guide or the 
antaryami. Though a person, he is said to be above all, 
in all, and through all. All things are of Him, in Him 
and unto Him. But as Jacobi would put it, an understood 
God is no God at all. To imagine God is what we think 
is nothing less than blasphemy. Though the God of religion 
is a limited expression of the absolute, it is not a mere 
imaginative presentation. In the development of the abso- 
lute into the universe conceived by the finite mind, the 
first existent being is the God or the universal soul pos- 
sessing self-consciousness. He is the absolute personified. 
The Upanisads do not care to identify Him with the ideal 
tendency of things opposing and struggling through the

non-ideal ; in that case He would be reduced to the level 
of the finite. According to the Upanisads, the Absolute 
and God are one ; we call it the supreme Brahman to 
emphasise its transcendence of the finite, its unknowability, 
its all-comprehensiveness ; we call it Isvara to emphasise 
the personal aspect so necessary for religious devotion. 
The relation between the two, the absolute Brahman and 
the personal Isvara, may be like that of the true Lord to 
the idol. 1 Yet the two are one. The absolute is both per- 
sonal and impersonal. 3 Meditation on the supreme becomes 
the passionate devotion to the Lord of the universe. The 
individual looks upon God as something transcendent, and 
feels acutely the need of grace. Devaprasada, or grace of 
God, is the condition of the deliverance of man from bondage. 
“ This Atman cannot be attained through study or intelli- 
gence or much learning — whom he wishes to attain by him 
it can be attained. To him the Atman reveals its true 
nature.” 3 Sometimes the religious passion grows so fervent 
that the devotee exclaims : “ It is He who inspires to do good 
works the man whom He will lead on high, and it is He 
who inspires to do evil works the man whom He will 
lead downwards.” 4 The oneness of God and man is 
realised only after a good deal of discipline and exercise. 
When the ideal of religion is reached, the personal conception 
is transcended. The higher we go in religious experience, 
the more we perceive the identity between the object of 
worship and the worshipper, till at last the two become one. 
Then there is no worship in the traditional sense of the 
term. The absolute is felt as a boundless spirit pervading 
the whole universe and flooding the soul of man. Our 
limits fall away and the defects incident to man’s imperfec- 
tion dissolve. The end of religion is the transcendence 
of religion. Ideal religion overcomes the duality with 
which it starts. Religious worship starts with fear, passes 
through reverence, love and communion with the eternal, 
and culminates in the ecstatic life, where God and the soul

PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 235 

melt into each other. Religious worship has to be accepted 
until the perfect condition is reached. 

Imperfect forms of worship are admitted as preparatory 
to the perfect. The Upanisads are led into inconsistent 
notions when they try to do too much justice to the con- 
flicting creeds which prevailed among the peoples of the 
time. Some believed in magic ; some tried to subdue the 
powers of nature by concentration and other ascetic prac- 
tices ; some were lost in a futile formalism ; some wor- 
shipped the Vedic gods ; some tried to effect an escape 
from this world of change by means of spiritual insight. 
The Upanisad thinkers, conscious of the weakness of 
human understanding which has to limit the God present 
in all things, at all times, and in all places to some special 
place, time and thing, recognise that if lower forms of 
worship are dismissed, there is the risk of banishing God 
altogether out of life. Some worship is better than none, 
and so it is said that we become whatever form we worship. 
“ Let him worship the Brahman as support, and he becomes 
supported. Let him worship Brahman as greatness, and 
he becomes great. Let him worship Brahman as mind, 
he becomes endowed with mind. And let him worship 
Brahman as Brahman, and he will become possessed of 
Brahman .” 1 God reveals Himself in different ways to 
different men. This is not to be confused with the doctrine 
of incarnations, which is unknown to the Upanisads. The 
Upanisads consider the highest form of religion to be 
spiritual meditation on the absolute ; next in rank is the 
passionate devotion to the one immanent Lord ; lowest of 
all is the worship of the Vedic devas and other deities. 

It is frequently urged that the Upanisads do not admit 
of any religious worship. Dr. Urquhart writes : “ However 
clearly the attitude of true worship may seem to be indicated, 
there is a constant refrain sometimes even in the same verse 
to the effect that the self who is to be worshipped is the 
self of the worshipper, and that consequently there is no 
such distinction between the two (God and man), as is 
demanded by the fully theistic relation.” 3 The Upanisads

are emphatic about the oneness of God and man. The 
relative difference we recognise between the two is taken 
over in a higher unity. “ If a man worships another 
divinity with the idea that he and the God are different, 
he does not know.” 1 The unity of spirit is the first prin- 
ciple of the Upanisad doctrine. Divine immanence is its 
central fact. If that is inconsistent with religious worship, 
it means only that theism has no place for true religion, 
since a true theism must accept divine immanence. All 
true religion declares that finite things are not self-sustained, 
are not self-evolved, but that God is over all, through all, 
in all, the ground of existence, the source of life and the 
goal of desire. " If I ascend up into heaven, thou art 
there : if I make my bed in hell, behold. Thou art there. 
If I take the wings of the morning, and dwell in the utter- 
most parts of the sea; even there shall Thy hand lead me.”* 
" Am I a God, at hand, saith the Lord and not a God afar 
off ? Can any hide himself in secret places that I shall 
not see him ? saith the Lord ; Do not I fill Heaven and 
earth ? ” “ In God, we live and move and have our being,” 3 

and “ He who dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God 
in him.” * All true religion recognises the immanence of 
God and is highly mystic.

Moksa or Release 

Is the highest state of religious realisation, the atone- 
ment with the supreme godhead, a mere vanishing into 
nothingness ? The Upanisad view is that there is in the 
highest condition a disintegration of individuality, a giving 
up of selfish isolation, but it is not a mere nothing or death. 
“ As the flowing rivers disappear in the sea, losing their 
name and form, thus a wise man, freed from name and 
form, goes to the divine person who is beyond all.” 5 The 
Upanisads do not recognise the ultimate reality of the

PHILOSOPHY OF THE UPANISADS 237 


narrow individual self. Those who pray for personal im- 
mortality take their stand on the ultimateness of the 
individual, and urge its maintenance beyond the world. 
The real in finite life, what is best in the individual’s nature, 
is the infinite, and that persists beyond the limits of physical 
existence. Nothing of value is lost. Whatever spiritual 
values we seek after on earth and find imperfectly, we 
possess in the highest condition absolutely. As human 
beings we reach our ideals imperfectly, in flashes and 
moments of insight. In the highest condition we attain 
to them perfectly, completely and absolutely. The Taitti- 
rfya Upanisad points out how the bliss we have in the 
world is only a shadow of the divine bliss, a feeble apology 
for it. 1 After all our troubles in the sea of life we do not 
reach a desert shore where we are obliged to die of hunger. 
The liberated condition must be looked upon as the fullest 
expression of the self. The ascent to God will be a lapse 
into the void or the abyss, if the ultimate Brahman is itself 
looked upon as an abstraction. Then the goal of man is 
annihilation. The Upanisads dispute such a conclusion. 
The highest is a state of rapture and ecstasy, a condition 
of ananda, where the creature as creature is abolished, but 
becomes one with the Creator, or more accurately realises 
his oneness with Him. We cannot describe this perfection 
adequately. We use symbols. The nature of eternal life 
is a condition of ananda or freedom, a state of joyous ex- 
pansion of the soul, where heaven and earth are felt to flow 
together. 

Its nature cannot be characterised except through image 
and metaphor. We have some states in this life which 
may be taken as illustrations of eternal or timeless existence. 
Baron Von Hiigel speaks to us of trance conditions which 
“ appear to the experiencing soul, in proportion to their 
concentration, as timeless, i.e. as non-successive, simul- 
taneous, hence as eternal. . . . The eternity of the soul is 
not here a conclusion drawn from the apparent God-likeness 
in other respects, of the soul when in this condition, 
but the eternity, on the contrary, is the very centre 
of the experience itself, and is the chief inducement 
• See ii. 8 ; Kausltaki, i. 3. 5 ; Brh., iv. 3. 33. 



238 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

to the soul for holding itself to be divine. The 
soul’s immortality cannot be experienced in advance of 
death, whilst its eternity, in the sense indicated, is or 
seems to be directly experienced in such " this-life ” states. 
Hence the belief in immortality is here derivative, that in 
eternity is primary .” 1 In the enjoyment of a melody, 
the contemplation of a work of art, in grasping an argument 
as a whole, we have the mystical condition, the sight of 
God, the experience of eternity.* The temporal happenings 
become eternal when viewed in relation to the absolute, 
and thus assigned their true worth. 

Since from our human point of view it is not possible 
to describe the fullness of the absolute reality, the Upanisads 
do not describe precisely the condition of ultimate freedom. 
There are two conflicting accounts running throughout : 
that it is a state of likeness to God, and that it is a state 
of oneness with God. 

There are passages where the individual is said to 
become one with the highest. “ The pranava is the bow, 
the Atman is the arrow, and the Brahman is said to be its 
mark. It should be hit by one who is self-collected, and 
that which hits becomes like the arrow, one with the

1 St. Augustine in his Confessions, says : '* Suppose all the tumult ol 
the flesh in us were hushed for ever, and all sensible images of earth and 
sea and air were put to silence ; suppose the heavens were still and even 
the soul spoke no words to itself, but passed beyond all thought of itself ; 
suppose all dreams and revelations of imagination were hushed with every 
word and sign and everything that belongs to this transitory world ; suppose 
they were all silenced — though, if they speak to one who hears, what they 
say is, ‘ We made not ourselves, but He made us who abides for ever ’ — yet 
suppose they only uttered this and then were silent, when they had turned 
the ears of the hearer to Him who made them, leaving Him to speak alone, 
not through them but through Himself, so that we could hear His words, 
not through any tongue of flesh nor by the voice of an angel, nor in thunder, 
nor in any likeness that hides what it reveals ; suppose then that the God 
whom through such manifestations we have learnt to love were to be 
revealed to us directly without any such mediation — just as, but now, we 
reached out of ourselves and touched by a flash of insight the eternal wisdom 
that abides above all ; suppose, lastly, that this vision of God were to be 
prolonged for ever, and all other inferior modes of vision were to be taken 
away, so that this alone should ravish and absorb the beholder and entrance 
him in mystic joy, and our very life for ever like the moment of clear insight 
and inspiration to which we rose — is not this just what is meant by the words

'mark, that is Brahman.” 1 The Atman becomes one with 
Brahman. 3 Here absolute identity between the soul and 
Brahman is asserted. Again, “ All these become one in the 
highest imperishable Brahman.” 3 " He becomes merged 
in the supreme undecaying Atman.” 4 “ He becomes 

omniscient and becomes all.” 5 " He enters into all.” 6 The 

redeemed soul enters into all things and becomes all things 
in spirit. “ Having attained him, the seers content with 
their knowledge, their purpose accomplished, free from all 
desire, and with full composure, having attained the all- 
pervading Atman on all sides, ever concentrating their 
minds, enter into everything. ” 7 They who see the whole 
universe held firm in the one all-enfolding presence cannot 
have any sorrow or torment. " Having without doubt 
well ascertained the significance of the knowledge of the 
Vedanta, the seekers, their minds purified by dint of re- 
nunciation attain the worlds of that Brahman, and when 
their body falls, their Atman being one with the highest 
immortal Brahman, are absolved all round.” 8 The liberated 
soul feels his oneness with God so intensely that he calls 
himself the creator of the world. “ I am the food, I am 
the food-eater. I am the subject, I am the object, I am 
the two together. I am the firstborn, the destroyer of the 
world also. I am the sunlike light. I am the centre of 
the world, of immortal gods.” 9 These passages seem to 
imply that there is no sense of individuality, and therefore 
no possibility of action in the highest state. It seems to 
be a survival without consciousness, where body is dissolved 
and mind extinguished and all is lost in a boundless dark- 
ness. If we please, we may call it the sleep without dreams, 
or the peace without understanding. When Yajnavalkya 
explains it to Maitreyi in the words: “As a lump of salt 
which is thrown into the water dissolves and cannot be 
gathered up again, but wherever water is drawn, it is salty, 
so truly is it with this great being, the endless, the unlimited,

are indifferent, if not opposed, to the authority of the Vedas. 
From the striking similarities in the lives and teachings of 
Buddha and Vardhamana, it is sometimes argued that the 
two svstems of Buddhism and Jainism are one, and that 
Jainism is only an offshoot of Buddhism. Barth writes : 
“ The legend of Vardhamana, or to apply to him the name 
which is most in use, Mahavira, the great hero, the Jina 
of the present age presents so many and so peculiar points 
of contact with that of Gautama Buddha, that we are instinct- 
ively led to conclude that one and the same person is the 
subject of both. Both are of royal birth ; the same names 
recur among their relations and disciples. They were born 
and they died in the same country and at the same period 
of time. According to the accepted reports, the nirvana 
of the Jina took place in 526 B.c.,that of Buddha in 543 B.c. ; 
and if we make allowances for the uncertainty inherent in 
these data, the two dates may be considered to be identical. 
Coincidences quite similar occur in the course of the two 
traditions. Like the Buddhists, the Jainas claim to have 
been patronised by the Maurya princes. A district which 
is a holy land for the one is almost always a holy land for 
the other, and their sacred places adjoin each other in Behar, 
in the peninsula of Guzerat, on mount Abu in Rajasthan, 
as well as elsewhere. If we collate together all these corre- 
spondences in doctrine, organisation, religious observances 
and traditions, the inference seems inevitable that one of 
the two religions is a sect, and in some degree the copy of 
the other. When in addition to this we think of the manifold 
relations which there are between the legend of Buddha 
and the Brahmanical traditions, relations which are wanting 
in the legend of Mahavira ; when we reflect, moreover, 
that Buddhism has on its behalf the testimony of the edicts 
of Asoka, and that from that time, the third century before 
our era, it was in possession of a literature, some of the titles 
of which have been transmitted to us, while the most ancient 
testimonies of an unquestionable nature in favour of Jainism 
do not go farther back than the fifth century after Christ ; 
when we reflect further that the chief sacred language of 
the Buddhists, the Pali, is almost as ancient as these edicts, 
while that of the Jainas, the Ardha-Magadhi, is a prakrit 



PLURALISTIC REALISM OF THE JAINAS 291 


dialect obviously more recent ; when we add to all these the 
conclusions, very uncertain it is true, in the present state 
of our knowledge, which are furnished by the internal char- 
acteristics of Jainism, such as its more mature systematisa- 
tion, its tendency to expatiate, and the pains it is always 
taking to demonstrate its antiquity, we shall feel no 
hesitation in admitting that of the two. Buddhism is 
the one which is best entitled to the claim of originality.” 1 
Colebrooke, however, contends that Jainism is older than 
Buddhism, since it adopts the animistic belief that nearly 
everything is possessed of a soul. 2 Either view goes against 
the Indian tradition which looks upon Jainism and Buddhism 
as two distinct faiths. The Hindu sastras never confuse 
them, and their testimony is confirmed by the researches 
of Guerinot, Jacobi and Biihler, among others. It is now 
conclusively established that Vardhamana was an historical 
person distinct from Gautama Buddha and Jainism a system 
quite independent of Buddhism. Guerinot has emphasised 
five great points of difference between Vardhamana and 
Gautama Buddha relating to their birth, the deaths of their 
mothers, their renunciation, illumination and death. Vard- 
hamana was born at Vaisall about 599 b.c., while Gautama 
was born at Kapilavastu about 567 B.c. Vardhamana’s 
parents lived up to a good old age, while Gautama’s mother 
died soon after giving birth to him. Vardhamana assumed 
the ascetic life with the consent of his relatives, while 
Gautama made himself a monk against the wishes of his 
father. Vardhamana had twelve years of ascetic preparation, 
while Gautama obtained illumination at the end of six 
years. Vardhamana died at Pawa in 527 b.c., while Gautama 
died at Kusinagar about 488 b.c. Jacobi attempts to prove 
the priority and independence of Jainism to Buddhism by 
several distinct lines of evidence which we shall briefly 
indicate here, referring the interested reader to his learned 
discussions . 3 The Nigganthas (those who have no bonds) 
of the Buddhist books are the followers of Vardhamana, 
and must be at least as old as the fourth century b.c., if not

older. The Ndtaputta of Pali Buddhist literature is Vard- 
hamana. A reference to the doctrine of the Nigganthas, as 
given in Buddhist canonical literature, confirms the identity 
of the Nigganthas and the Jains. “The Niggantha Nata- 
putta. . . knows and sees all things, claims perfect know- 
ledge and faith ; teaches the annihilation by austerities of 
the old karma and prevention by inactivity of new 
karma. When karma ceases, misery ceases.” 1 * 3 Asoka’s edicts 
refer to the sect of the Jains.* The Buddhist books them- 
selves refer to the Jainas as the rivals of Buddhism. 
Internal evidence confirms the view of independence. The 
Jaina theory of the soul and knowledge are so distinctive 
of Jainism and dissimilar to those of Buddhism that one 
cannot be a borrowed product of the other. The similarities 
in doctrine between the two on the questions of karma 
and rebirth prove nothing, since these are the common features 
of all Indian systems. For these reasons we look upon 
Jainism as an earlier creed than Buddhism. M. Poussin 
is of opinion that the Jains were “ a powerful mendicant 
order which originated or was reorganised a few years before 
Sakyamuni.” 3 

According to Colebrooke, Jainism and Samkhya philo- 
sophy have some points in common. They both believe 
in the eternity of matter and the perpetuity of the world. 
The dualism of the one is not unlike that of the other. 
Only while the Saiiikhya derives the development of the 
material world and living beings from the principles of purusa 
and prakrti, the Jains trace them all to primeval nature. 4 
The similarity is only apparent. The Jaina conception of 
the activity of the soul has more in common with the 
Nyaya-Vaiserika theory than with the Samkhya view of 
the unaffected and inactive nature of the soul ; nor do we

find much agreement between the two in any essential 
doctrine such as causation. 

Attempts are sometimes made by students of Jainism to 
represent it as a revolt of the critical fair-minded Ksatriya, 
against the clever unscrupulous Brahmin, who disallowed to 
all others the privilege of entering on the fourth order of 
the sannyasins, and claimed exclusive control of the sacrifices. 
Such a theory cannot be sustained when we realise that 
the Brahmin made no such claim as regards the order of the 
sannyasin, for all the upper classes were allowed to pass 
through the asramas. Were the exclusiveness of the Brahmin 
the cause of revolt, it should have been led not by the 
Ksatriyas, who were as good or as bad as the Brahmins in 
this respect, but by the other classes. We have no reason 
to believe that the suffering of the common people led to 
the rise of Jainism. It is an expression of the general ferment 
of thought which prevailed at the beginning of the epic 
period, and we need not invent any anti-Brahmin prejudice 
for an explanation of its rise. When different views of life 
and doctrine professed by different peoples come into touch 
with each other, there is bound to be an interpenetration 
of thought, giving rise to an extraordinary development of 
feeling and belief, and Jainism is one manifestation of this 
mental unrest. 

The doctrine of rebirth enunciated in the Upanisads, 
sometimes in an extravagant form, led to the idea that all 
things in the world possessed souls. Naturally the Jaina 
believed that every material thing, fire, wind and plant, 
also had a spirit in it. On such a view the simple joy of 
the earlier peoples in sacrifices could not last. The times 
were ripe for revolt. The belief that all things, animals 
and insects, plants and leaves, were possessed of souls, when 
coupled with the idea of rebirth, led to a horror of taking life 
in any form. Vardhamana insisted that we should not 
injure life whether in sport or in sacrifice. To strengthen 
the position of protest, the Jains denied God for whose 
propitiation the sacrifices were being offered. God cannot 
be held responsible for the sorrows of life. Jainism seeks 
to show’ a way out of the misery of life by austerity, inward 
and outward. When we become perfect, we do not escape 



294 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

into a nirvana of nothingness, but enter into a state of being 
without qualities and relations, and removed from all chances 
of rebirth. 

The Jaina system is looked upon as unorthodox (avaidika), 
since it does not accept the authority of the Veda. It is 
not therefore possible for it to look upon its own system 
of thought as a mere revelation by the Jina. Its claim to 
acceptance is its accordance with reality. Its scheme of 
the universe is said to be based on logic and experience. 
In their metaphysics, the Jainas accept the Vedic realism, 
though they do not systematise it in the spirit of the Upani- 
sads. Prakrti is analysed and given an atomic constitution. 
The purusas cease to be passive spectators, but become 
active agents. The central features of Jaina philosophy 
are its realistic classification of being, its theory of knowledge, 
with its famous doctrines of Syadvada and Saptabhangi, 
or seven-fold mode of predication and its ascetic ethics. Here, 
as in the other systems of Indian thought, practical ethics 
is wedded to philosophical speculation. The realistic 
metaphysics and ascetic ethics may have come down to 
Vardhamana from his predecessors, but the theory of 
knowledge is probably due to him, and is not without its 
interest to the modern student of the history of philosophy. 

V 

Theory of Knowledge 

The Jains admit five kinds of knowledge : mati, £ruti, 
avadhi, manahparyaya and kevala. 1 (i) Mati is ordinary 
cognition, obtained by normal means of sense perception. It 
includes .-'inrti or remembrance and sarnjna or pratyabhijna 
or recognition ; curitaor tarka, or induction based on observa- 
tion ; abhinibodha or anumana, or deductive reasoning. 2 
Matijnana is sometimes distinguished into three kinds, viz. 
upalabdhi or perception, bhavana or memory, and upayoga 
or understanding. 3 Matijnana is knowledge by means of

PLURALISTIC REALISM OF THE JAINAS 295 


the indriyas or the senses and mind, which is called anindriya, 
to distinguish it from senses. We always have sense pre- 
sentation or darsana prior to the rise of matijnana. (2) £ruti 
or testimony is knowledge derived through signs, symbols 
or words. While matijnana gives us knowledge by acquaint- 
ance, this gives only knowledge by description. Srutajnana 
is of four kinds, namely, labdhi or association, bhavana or 
attention, upayoga or understanding, and naya or aspects 
of the meaning of things. 1 Naya is noticed here since the 
different interpretations of the scriptural texts come up for 
discussion. (3) Avadhi is direct knowledge of things even 
at a distance of time or space. It is knowledge by clairvoy- 
ance. (4) Manahparyaya is direct knowledge of the thoughts 
of others, as in telepathic knowledge of others’ minds. 
(5) Kevala or perfect knowledge comprehends all substances 
and their modifications. 2 It is omniscience unlimited by 
space, time or object. To the perfect consciousness the 
whole reality is obvious. This knowledge, which is indepen- 
dent of the senses, which can only be felt and not described, 
is possible only for purified souls free from bondage. 

The first three kinds of knowledge are liable to error, 
while the last two cannot be wrong. 3 The validity of know- 
ledge consists in its practical efficiency, in its enabling us 
to get what is good and avoid what is evil. Valid know- 
ledge is a faithful representation of objects, and is therefore 
practically useful. Invalid knowledge represents things in 
relations in which they do not exist. When we mistake a 
rope for a snake, our error consists in seeing a snake where 
it is not. Invalid knowledge is subject to contradiction, 
while valid knowledge is not so. Erroneous knowledge is 
what is characterised by sam£aya or doubt (affecting mati 
and sruti), viparyaya or mistake, or the opposite of truth 
(which may be found in avadhi), and anadhyavasaya or 
w'rong knowledge caused by carelessness or indifference. 
We have eight kinds of knowledge, the five right and the 
three wrong ones. Only one kind of knowdedge is active 
at a time.4 

Knowledge is pratyaksa or direct, when it is immediate

and paroksa or indirect when it is mediated by some other 
kind of knowledge. Of the five kinds of knowledge, mati 
and sruti are paroksa and the rest pratyaksa. 1 Mati 
or ordinary cognition which we obtain by the senses and mind 
is paroksa, since there is dependence on the senses.- There 
are some, however, who view sense knowledge as pratyaksa 
or direct. “ Perception or darsana is of four kinds, perception 
through visual sensations, perception through non-visual 
senses, again that through the faculty of avadhi or clairvoy- 
ance, and lastly through kevala or infinite perception, which 
is unlimited and apprehends all reality.” 3 

Caitanya or consciousness is the essence of jlva, and the 
two manifestations of caitanya are perception (darsana) 
and intelligence (jnana).r In darsana the details are not 
perceived, while in jnana they are. The former is simple 
apprehension, the latter conceptual knowledge. “ That 
perception of the generalities (samanya) of things without 
particularities (vi£esa) in which there is no grasping of 
details is called darsana.5 It involves several stages, which 
are : (r) Vyanjanavagraha, where the stimulus acts on the 
peripheral ends of the sense organs and brings the subject 
into a certain relation with the object ; ( 2 ) Arthavagraha, 

1 U.T.S., i. 11 and 12. » U.T.S., i. 14. 

1 P. 48. See also Siddhasena Divakara, Nvavavatara, 4. Sometimes 
pratyaksa is said to be of two kinds, saiiivyavaharika and paramarthika. 
The latter includes avadhi, manahparyaya and kevala, and the former both 
what is caused by the senses (indriyanibandliana) and wh .t is not caused 
by them (anlndriyanibandhana). The Saiiivyavaharika pratyaksa is what 
we have in everyday life and on it perception and memory depend. It is 
defined by the Pramdnamimamsavrtti as the act of satisfying a desire 
to cognise. 'Samiclnali pravrttinivrttirupo vyavahlrah saiiivyavaharah. 
Pratyaksa is entire or sakala in the case of kevalin’s knowledge and vikala, 
or deficient in other cases.) Parok-a is divided into five kinds : of (1) smrta 
or memory- of what is already experienced, as when we remember a man 
whom we saw before; (2) pratyabhij 'a. or knowledge derived from resem- 
blances of things, as when we identify a new object with something about 
which we read before; (3) tarka, or reasoning from universals ; (4) anumana 
or knowledge by means of the middle term ; and (5) figama or verbal 
testimony of an undent being. In the PraindnanayataW al ihalamhara, 
the distinction betwee n direct (pratyaksa) and indirect (paroksa) knowledge 
is said to be one of degree of clearness. See II and III. It is, because, accord- 
ing to the Jains, the outer sense activity is only ar. indirect help to the rise 
of perceptual knowledge.

where consciousness is excited and a sensation felt, where 
the person is barely conscious of the object ; (3) lha, where 
the mind desires to know the details of the object, its resem- 
blances to and differences from others ; (4) Avaya, where 
takes place the reintegration of the present and the past, 
and the recognition of the object as this and not that; and 
(5) Dharana, where we recognise that sensations reveal quali- 
ties of things. An impression 1 results by which we are able to 
remember the object later. This analysis reveals the mediate 
character of perception, and also tells us that things are 
extra-mental realities. The existence of an objective reality 
beyond and beside consciousness, apprehended by percep- 
tion and understood by intelligence, is asserted by the Jainas. 
The attributes and relations of things are directly given in 
experience and are not products of thought or imagination. 
The process of knowing does not modify the object of know- 
ledge. The relation between knowledge and its object is an 
external one with regard to physical objects, though it is 
different in the case of self-consciousness. The consciousness 
of the jlva is ever active, and this activity reveals its own 
nature as well as that of the object. Jheya or object of 
knowledge includes self and not self. As light reveals 
itself and other objects, even so does jhana reveal itself 
and others. The Nyaya-Vaisesika theory, that knowledge 
reveals only external relations but not itself, is rejected by 
the Jainas. In knowing any object, the self knows itself 
simultaneously. If it did not know its own existence, 
none else could impart this knowledge to it. Every act 
of perception and knowledge implies the statement “ I know 
it thus and thus.” Knowledge is always appropriated by 
the self. The question, how consciousness can reveal 
the nature of unconscious objects, is dismissed as absurd, 
since it is the nature of knowdedge to reveal objects. 

In the case of self-consciousness, the relation between 
knowledge (jfiana) and the object of knowledge (jneya) 
is very intimate. Jhanin and jnana, the subject of know- 
ledge and knowledge are also inseparable, though distinguish- 
able. In self-consciousness, the subject of knowledge, the 
object of knowledge, and knowledge itself are different 

■ S.imskara. 



298 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

aspects of a single concrete unity. There are no jivas 
without jnana, since that would take away the cetana or 
conscious character of the jivas and reduce them to the 
level of ajiva dravyas, and there can be no jnana without 
selves, for that would make jnana foundationless. 

In its perfect condition the soul is pure jnana and darsana 
(knowledge and intuition), 1 which arise simultaneously, 
or are together. In the mundane jivas, jnana is preceded 
by darsana. 2 Perfect knowledge is free from doubt (samsaya), 
perversity (vimoha) and indefiniteness (vibhrama).3 The 
karmas which obscure the different varieties of darsana 
are called the Darsanavaranlya karmas, and those which 
obscure the different kinds of jnana are called the jhana- 
varaniya karmas. 4 All knowledge is in the soul, though it 
manifests itself when the disturbing media are removed. 
The impediments are passions and emotions, which cause 
the inflow of matter and prevent the soul from exercising 
its natural function in full measure, and interests in 
the physical concerns of life which coniine our know- 
ledge to the immediately useful. So aspects of reality 
in which we are not interested are shut off by selective 
attention. When the soul is unimpeded by the influences 
of matter which obscure knowledge, and freely functions, 
it is capable of omniscience, or knowledge of all things, 
past, present and future. In our empirical lives, the purity 
of the soul is defiled by the absorption of the unconscious 
substance, matter. By tearing it asunder, by destroying 
its energies, we tend to increase our knowledge. When 
the opposing energies are completely overthrown, the soul 
vibrates at its natural rhythm and exercises its function of 
unlimited knowing. Souls are substances characterised 
by intelligence, and their differences are due to the degrees 
of their connexions with matter. 

Knowledge is of two forms, pramdna, or knowledge of a 
thing as it is in itself, and nay a, or knowledge of a thing in its 
relation. The doctrine of nayas or standpoints is a peculiar 
feature of the Jaina logic. A naya is a standpoint from which 
we make a statement about a thing. We define and separate

4 For a classification of these, see Jami : Outlines of Jainism, pp. 30-31. 



PLURALISTIC REALISM OF THE JAINAS 299 


our standpoints by abstraction. The conceptions that 
belong to them, or partial views, are the outcome of purposes 
that we pursue. The result of this abstraction and concen- 
tration on particular ends is the relativity of knowledge. 
To occupy one particular standpoint is not to deny the 
others. For certain purposes the view that the sun goes 
round the earth is quite as effective as the other, that the 
earth goes round the sun. Even in the Upanisads we have 
glimpses of how reality reveals itself in different ways at 
different stages of our knowledge. Much of the confusion 
of Buddhism is due to its false exaggeration of the relative 
principle of flow into the absolute truth. What is true 
from one standpoint may not be true from another. Par- 
ticular aspects are never adequate to the whole reality. The 
relative solutions are abstractions under which reality may 
be regarded, but do not give us a full and sufficient account 
of it. Jainism makes basic and fundamental the principle 
that truth is relative to our standpoints. The general 
character of reality is given in several partial views. 

There are many ways in which nayas are divided, and 
we shall notice the chief of them here. According to one 
scheme, there are seven nayas, of which four refer to objects 
or meanings, and three to words, and all these lead to falla- 
cies (abhasas) when taken as absolute and entire. The artha 
(object or meaning) nayas are the following : — 

(i) Naigamanaya. There are two ways in which it is 
interpreted. It is said that it relates to the purpose or end 
of a course of activity which is present throughout. When 
we see a man carrying water, fire, utensils, etc., and we ask 
him, “ What are you doing ? ” he says, “ I am cooking food,” 
we have an illustration of Naigamanaya. It tells us of the 
general purpose which controls the series of acts and empha- 
sises the teleological character of life. 1 This view is adopted 
by Pujyapada. Siddhasena adopts a different view. We 
have naigamanaya when we comprehend a thing as having 
both generic and specific qualities and we do not distin- 
guish between them. (2) Samgrahanaya emphasises the 
common features. It is the class point of view. 
Though it is true that the class is not real apart from 

1 See commentary on T.S., I. 33. 



300 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

individuals, it is sometimes useful to notice the general 
features. This Sarhgrahanaya is of two kinds, Parasariigraha 
or the ultimate class view, which takes into account the fact 
that all things partake of the nature of reality. Aparasarh- 
graha is the inferior class view. The abstract absolutist 
position is regarded as the abhasa of the Samgrahanaya. 
Jainism admits the distinction between samanya or universal 
and visesa or particular features, though it regards it as a 
relative one. Samkhya and Advaita Vedanta deny viscsas, 
while Buddhism denies samanya. Nyaya-Vaisssika accepts 
both, and looks upon the concrete thing as a complex made 
up of the universal and the particular. But Jainism con- 
siders the distinction to be a relative one, while Nyaya- 
Vaisesika looks upon it as absolute. (3) Vyavahdranaya 
is the popular conventional point of view based on empirical 
knowledge. We know things in their entirety and emphasise 
their striking individualities. The specific features arrest 
attention. The hypothesis of materialism, and we may add 
pluralism, are the abhasas of this naya. (4) Rjusutranaya 
is narrower than the Vyavaharanaya. It takes into account 
the state of a thing at a particular point or time. It over- 
looks all continuity and identity. To it the real is the 
momentary. A thing is what it is at the present moment. 
The Jains look upon it as the presupposition of the Buddhist 
philosophy. While this naya is useful to expose the hollowness 
of an abstract philosophy of “ being,” it is useless as an ulti- 
mate account of truth. The remaining three are Sabdanayas. 
(5) Sabdattaya is based on the fact that a name has the function 
of calling up to our mind the particular object referred to 
or implied by the name, whatever it be, an individual thing, 
attribute, relation or action. Each name has its own meaning, 
and different words may also refer to the same object. The 
relation between terms and their meanings is a relative one, 
and if we forget this, fallacies arise. (6) Samabhirudhanaya 
distinguishes terms according to their roots. It is an applica- 
tion of the Sabdanaya. (7) Evambhutanaya is a specialised 
form of the sixth kind. Of the various aspects and gradations 
in the manifestation of a thing, only one is contemplated 
by the root of a term, and it is this aspect that is the legiti- 
mate meaning of a term in its current usage. The same 



PLURALISTIC REALISM OF THE JAINAS 301 


thing in a different attitude must be designated by a diff erent 
term altogether. Each of these seven nayas has a larger 
extent than that which follows it. Naigama has the largest 
extent and Evambhuta the least. Each naya or point of 
1 view represents one of the many ways from which a thing 
can be looked at. If any one point of view is mistaken 
for the whole we have a nayabhasa. According to the Jains, 
the Nyaya-Vysesika, the Samkhya, the Advaita Vedanta, 
and the Buddhist systems adopt the first four nayas respec- 
tively and mistake them for the whole truth. 

The nayas are also distinguished into (i) dravyarthika, 
from the point of view of substance, and (2) paryayarthika, 
from the point of view of modification or condition. Each 
of them has several subdivisions. The dravyarthika nayas 
consider the permanent nature of things, while the paryayar- 
thika ones relate to their perishable aspects. 

Since all these standpoints are relative, we have also 
what is called the NayanEcaya, or the true and com- 
plete point of view. The Niscayanaya is of two kinds, 
SuddhanEcaya and Asuddhaniscaya. The former deals 
with the pure unconditioned reality, while the latter contem- 
plates conditioned existence. 

To those familiar with the conception of philosophy as 
a criticism of categories, we need not say that this doctrine 
of nayas or standpoints is a logical one. The Jains are 
fond of quoting the old story of the six blind men, who each 
laid hands on a different part of the elephant and tried to 
describe the whole animal. The man who caught the ear 
thought that the creature resembled a winnowing fan, the 
holder of the leg imagined that he was clinging to a big round 
pillar, etc. It was he who saw the whole that perceived 
that each had only a portion of the truth. Almost all 
philosophical disputes arise out of a confusion of standpoints. 
The question is often asked, whether the effect is the same 
as its material cause or different from it. That it pre-exists 
in the cause and is made manifest by the operation which 
that cause undergoes is the view of satkaryavada, adopted 
by the Vedanta and the Samkhya philosophies. The asatkar- 
yavada of the Vaisesikas urges that the effect is something 
new and did not exist before. Jainism decides the dispute 



302 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

by a reference to the different standpoints implied in the two. 
If we consider the effect such as a gold necklace to be a mere 
substance, it is the same as the gold of which it is made ; 
but if we look at the necklace as a modification, it is new, 
and did not exist in the mere substance of gold. The con- 
tributions which each standpoint makes are always partial 
views reached by processes of abstraction. 

The most important use of these standpoints is of course 
the Syadvada or the Saptabhangi. It is the use in seven 
different ways of judgments which affirm and negate, severally 
and jointly, without self-contradiction, thus discriminating 
the several qualities of a thing. The difficulty of predication 
is got over on the Jaina theory, since it holds that subject 
and predicate are identical from the point of view of 
substance and different from the point of view of 
modification. 

The view is called Syadvada, since it holds all knowledge 
to be only probable. Every proposition gives us only a 
perhaps, a may be or a syad. We cannot affirm or deny any- 
thing absolutely of any object. There is nothing certain 
on account of the endless complexity of things. It emphasises 
the extremely complex nature of reality and its indefiniteness. 
It does not deny the possibility of predication, though it 
disallows absolute or categorical predication. The dynamic 
character of reality can consist only with relative or con- 
ditional predication. Every proposition is true, but only 
under certain conditions, i.e. hypothetically. 

It holds that there arc seven different ways of speaking 
of a thing or its attributes, according to the point of view. 
There is a point of view from which substance or attribute 
(i) is, (2) is not, (3) is and is not, (4) is unpredicable, (5) is 
and is unpredicable, (6) is not and is unpredicable, and 
(7) is, is not and is unpredicable. 

1. Syad asti. From the point of view of its own material, 
place, time and nature, a thing is, i.e. exists as itself. The 
jar exists as made of clay, in my room at the present moment, 
of such and such a shape and size. 

2. Syad nasti. From the point of view of the material, 
place, time and nature of another thing, a thing is not, i.e. 
it is not no-tliing. The jar does not exist as made oi 



PLURALISTIC REALISM OF THE JAINAS 303 


metal, at a different place or time or of a different shape 
and size. 

3. Syad asti nasti. From the point of view of the same 
quaternary, relating to itself and another thing, it may be 
said that a thing is and is not. In a certain sense the jar 
exists and in a certain sense it does not. We say here what a 
thing is as well as what it is not. 

4. Syad avaktavya. While in three we make statements 
that a thing is in its own self and is not, as another succes- 
sively, it becomes impossible to make these statements at 
once. In this sense a thing is unpredicable. Though the 
presence of its own nature and the absence of other-nature 
are both together in the jar, still we cannot express them. 

5. Syad asti avaktavya. From the point of view of its 
own quaternary and at the same time from the joint quarter- 
nary of itself and no-thing, a thing is and is unpredicable. 
We note here both the existence of a thing and its indescriba- 
bility. 

6. Syad nasti avaktavya. From the point of view of 
the quaternary of the no-thing and at the same time from the 
joint quaternary of itself and no-thing, a thing is not and is 
also unpredicable. We note here what a thing is not as well 
as its indescribability. 

7. Syad asti nasti avaktavya. From the point of view 
of its own quarternary as well as that of no-thing and at 
the same time from the joint quaternary of itself and no-thing, 
a thing is, is not and is indescribable. We bring out the 
inexpressibility of a thing as well as what it is and what it is 
not. 1 

Of these seven possible ways of speaking about a thing 
or its attributes, the first two are the chief, the simple affirma- 
tive that a thing is in its svarupa (own form), svadravya (own 
matter), svaksetra (own place), and svakala (own time), 
and the simple negative that a thing is not in its pararupa 
(other form), paradravya (other matter), paraksetra (other 
place), and parakala (other time.) The latter is the negative 
fact. This doctrine insists on the correlativity of affirmation 
and negation. All judgments are double-edged in their 
character. All things are existent as well as non-existent 
« T.S., p. 14 ; P. 16. 



304 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

(sadasadatmakam ). 1 A thing is what it is and is not what it 
is not. According to this view, all negation has a positive 
basis. Even imaginary concepts like skyflower possess a 
positive basis in the two reals sky and flower, though their 
combination is unreal. It emphasises the fundamenta 1 
truth that distinction is necessary for thought. A thing 
which has nothing from which it can be distinguished is 
unthinkable. The absolute devoid of distinctions within as 
well as without is truly unthinkable. For all things which 
are objects of thought are in one sense and are not in 
another. 

Samkara and Ramanuja 2 criticise the Saptabhangi 
view on the ground of the impossibility of contradictory 
attributes co-existing in the same thing. Ramanuja writes: 
" Contradictory attributes such as existence and non-existence 
cannot at the same time belong to one thing, any more than 
light and darkness.” The Jains admit that a thing cannot 
have self-contradictory attributes at the same time and in 
the same sense. All that they say is that everything is of 
a complex nature, an identity in difference. The real 
comprehends and reconciles differences in itself. Attributes 
which are contradictory in the abstract coexist in life and 
experience. The tree is moving in that its branches are 
moving, and it is not moving since it is fixed to its place 
in the ground. It is necessary for us to know a thing clearly 
and distinctly, in its self-existence as well as in its relations 
to other objects. The second point urged by the Vedantins 
that the Saptabhangi doctrine is of no practical utility 
is an expression of personal opinion over which we need not 
linger. Nor can it be contended that the Saptabhangi 
doctrine is inconsistent with the other views of the Jaina 
philosophy. It is a logical corollary of the anekantavada, 
the doctrine of the manyness of reality. Since reality is 
multiform and ever changing, nothing can be considered 
to be existing everywhere and at all times and in all ways 
and places, and it is impossible to pledge ourselves to an 
inflexible creed

Value of Jaina Logic 

Before we pass on to the next section, it may be useful 
to bring together at this point a few critical reflections 
suggested by the Jaina logic. We have incidentally mentioned 
the strong points of the theory of knowledge of the Jainas 
and defended it against the attacks of the Vedantins. Yet in 
our opinion the Jaina logic leads us to a monistic idealism, 
and so far as the Jainas shrink from it they are untrue to 
their own logic. We shall enforce this criticism from the 
metaphysical side at a later stage of our discussion. Let 
us here understand the implications of the Jaina logic. 

The theory of relativity cannot be logically sustained 
without the hypothesis of an absolute. It is true that the 
law of contradiction on which Jaina logic takes its stand 
involves that distinction is necessary for thought, but a 
thing which is absolutely distinct from others is as unreal 
to thought as a thing which is absolutely one with others. 
Thought is not mere distinction, but it is also relation. 
Everything is possible only in relation to and as distinct 
from others. The law of contradiction is the negative aspect 
of the law of identity. All distinction presupposes unity. 
Since for the Jainas thought furnishes the clue to reality, 
the final expression of reality must be a concrete monism 
that accounts for all existence. It is not a one excluding 
the many, or a many excluding order or unity. The Jaina 
logic revolts against all abstractions, and will not commit 
itself to any false distinction of either-or, one or many. The 
Jainas admit that things are one in their universal aspect 
(jati or karana) and many in their particular aspect (vyakti 
or karya). Both tin se, according to them, are partial 
points of view. A plurality of reals is admittedly a relative 
truth. We must rise to the complete point of view and look 
at the whole with all the wealth of its attributes. If Jainism 
stops short with plurality, which is at best a relative and 
partial truth, and does not ask whether there is any higher 
truth pointing to a one which particularises itself in the 



306 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

objects of the world, connected with one another vitally, 
essentially and immanently, it throws overboard its own 
logic and exalts a relative truth into an absolute one. 

Only such a theory of monism is consistent with the 
Jaina theory of relations which are not independent of 
and external to what they relate. Meaning enters into 
reality, and between subject and object there is an intimate 
relation. The dualism of mind and external world, whatever 
truth it may have at the psychological level, is overcome 
when we rise to the standpoint of logic as theory of know- 
ledge. If the two, subject and object, the individual mind 
and the independent reality, are separate, then there can be 
no knowledge at all. Either knowledge is arbitrary and 
groundless or the dualism is w'rong. Subject and object are 
not separate existences held together by an external bond. 
They are a unity in duality, a duality in unity. If w'e 
suppress either term, the whole is dissolved. The distinction 
of subject and object is not a relation between two inde- 
pendent entities, but a distinction made by knowledge 
itself within its own field. If Jaina logic does not recognise 
the need for this principle, which includes within it the 
distinction of subject and object, it is because it takes a 
partial view for the whole truth. 

If we are to accept the above interpretation of its principle 
of relativity, the self which takes up the different points of 
view cannot be the particular empirical self, but something 
deeper. Knowledge is not merely individual. If the analysis 
of reality is to be more than subjective, we must admit the 
activity of one self in the many individuals whom we know 
empirically as objects of knowledge. Before any question 
of knowledge arises, this one self must be presupposed as 
the ultimate and final fact within which fall all distinctions 
of subject and object. And this self is not a passing feeling 
or a transient phase of consciousness. 

The fact that w'e are conscious of our relativity means 
that w'e have to reach out to a fuller conception. It is from 
that higher absolute point of view that the lower relative 
ones can be explained. All true explanation is from above 
downwards. 

It is only in the light of this absolute principle that we 



PLURALISTIC REALISM OF THE JAINAS 307 


shall be able to apply a scale of values to the relative con- 
ceptions and estimate their worth. All truth is relative 
when compared with the absolute truth. All knowledge 
transcends the given and points beyond itself. With a 
continuous advance towards fuller and fuller truth, the object 
itself loses its apparently given character. When we reach 
absolute knowledge the distinction between subject and 
object is overcome. Only in the light of such an absolute 
standard could we correct the abstractions of the lower. 
Then shall we see that the several relatives are only stages 
in a continuous process which has the realisation of the 
soul’s freedom for its determining end. The recognition 
of every form of knowledge as relative, something bound to 
pass over into something else, requires us to assume a larger 
reality, an absolute in which all the relatives fall. 

But is there any way of comprehending the nature 
of this absolute ? We cannot get an idea of the positive 
full-orbed reality by putting together our partial views. A 
mere pooling of the contributions of the different standpoints 
will not lead us to the truth in itself. If we follow the spirit 
of Jaina logic, thought is bound up with the relative and 
cannot give us a knowledge of the absolute. If thought 
cannot grasp reality, is there any other power that can ? 
The question is not explicitly raised, but the answer is 
implicitly given in the affirmative. A careful consideration 
of Kevalajnana, or the knowledge possessed by the free, 
will tell us that the Jaina theory by implication accepts the 
method of intuition and the philosophy of absolutism. 

According to the Jaina theory, the highest kind of know- 
ledge which combines all the characters manifested in 
experience is that possessed by the Kevalin or the liberated. 
It is full or perfect knowledge which is the soul’s characteristic 
in its pure and undefiled condition. This perfect knowledge 
which is the essence of the soul, manifests itself in different 
degrees in different kinds of beings on account of the influence 
of the external force of matter wdiose association or union 
has the effect of suppressing the clear knowledge of the 
soul. This unconscious matter, w'hen it joins the soul 
substance, cripples its powers according to the type of bondage 
or fusion of soul and matter The different types of con-

sciousness depend on the operation of the opposing forces 
of matter, ranging from that in which these forces are actually 
in full play, in which case the knowing power of the soul 
can manifest itself only through the one sense of touch, 
as in metals and the like, to that in which all of them are 
removed, when the full blaze of omniscience is reached. The 
intermediate types between these two limits are determined 
by the destruction, entire or partial, of the energies obstructing 
knowledge. Knowledge which is of the essence of the soul, 
is hidden or revealed according to the pressure of matter 
upon it. Everything lies latent in the self, and only wants 
removal of the causes which prevent the manifestation 
of knowledge. When the impediments are removed, the 
soul becomes all comprehensive knowledge, unlimited by 
time or space. There are no emotions to disturb or interests 
to obscure the full splendour of that soul whose essence is 
consciousness. Nor can we say that there are differentiating 
marks in this perfect condition. The object of knowledge 
is the whole of reality, and the subject has become pure 
intelligence, wherein no limits or distinctions are possible. 
The unreal distinctions of the empirical world are no longer 
present in it. In short, the distinctions are due to an element 
which docs not persist, and what persists is the soul whose 
nature is consciousness. The Jainas cannot logically support 
a theory of pluralism.

Psychology 

Before we take up the metaphysical views of the Jainas, 
we may notice their psychological opinions. They admit 
a dualism between mind and body. The five senses or 
indriyas are distinguished into dravya-indriyas or physical 
sense organs and bhava-indriyas or their psychical counter- 
parts . 1 The common element between the eye which is 

* T.S., ii. 19. Similarly, manas has the two aspects of physical and 
psychical. When the soul is said to occupy the whole body, it means that 
soul and body are the psychical and physical counterparts of one entity. 
It is an empty device to account for the psychical perception of physical 
objects. We do not solve the problem of the relation of soul and body by 
repeating the properties of both in every sense or indriya. 



PLURALISTIC REALISM OF THE JAINAS 309 


the enjoyer of form and its object is colour. Tire eye is 
adapted to respond to colour, which is a property of matter. 
Since the sense organs are only the exteriorised powers 
or instruments of the jlva, the elements which render the 
enjoyment of all objects possible exist in the constitution 
of the soul itself. The senses are the capacities for enjoy- 
ment, and the sensible qualities which exist outside are 
the objects of enjoyment. A good deal of psychological 
analysis is discernible in the divisions of touch into eight 
kinds : hot and cold, rough and smooth, soft and hard, 
light and heavy ; of taste into five : pungent, acid, bitter, 
sweet and astringent ; of smell into two : good and bad ; 
of colour into five : black, blue, yellow, white and pink ; 
and sound into seven: sadja, rsabha, gandhara, madh- 
yama, pancama, daivata, nisada, i.e. do, re, me, fa, 
sol, la, si. Sense perception is the result of the contact 
between the sense organ and the object. This mechanical 
contact is not the complete explanation of the psychical per- 
ception. It only helps to remove the veil which hides 
the knowledge of the soul. The subject is a jnanin, a 
bhoktr as well as a kartr, a knower, an enjoyer 
and a doer. Three forms of consciousness are recognised : 
knowing, feeling, or the experiencing of the fruits of karma 1 
and willing.* Conation and feeling are closely allied. As a 
rule, we have first feeling, then conation, and lastly know- 
ledges The relation between jlva and pudgala is that of 
subject to object. The force which brings about their union 
is not knowledge, for we may know a thing and yet not be 
compelled to act on it. The omniscience of the Siddhatman 
involves the reflection of the universe in consciousness, 
though the soul is not necessarily in bondage. Interaction 
depends on the desires of the jlva. This subjection to desire 
and consequently to bondage is not essential for the jiva, 
since it is possible to be saved from desire. 

Every jlva is a composite of body and soul, of which the 
soul is the active partner, while the body is the inactive 
passive one. Jainism avoids the defects of both mentalism 
and materialism by recognising the correlativity of mind 
and matter. But Jainism does not see that the distinction 
1 Karmaphalacetana. * P. 38. I P. 39. 



310 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

of self and not-self is the outcome of the essential character 
of mind. It accepts the two substance theory in all its 
nakedness, looking upon knowledge as something apart - 
a process taking place between them. Nor is Jainism aware 
of the conception of development according to which the body 
in its higher phases assumes new properties. It is obliged 
to rest content with a dualism of mind and body and stop 
at the psychological point of view. It cannot adopt the 
theory of interaction, but has to accept the view of parallelism 
with all its difficulties. “ Karmic matter itself through its 
own essential nature brings about its own changes. Jiva, 
too, in the same way, through its own impure states of thought 
that are conditioned by karma, brings about its own thought 
changes.” 1 The two form two independent series, self- 
sufficient and complete. To the question, as to why the 
jiva should suffer the fruits of karma, if the two are inde- 
pendent, a sort of pre-established harmony is suggested. 2 In 
the world we have material bodies large and small, of which 
some are karmic matter, with a tendency to be attracted 
by the jivas. By their coexistence, jiva and karmic 
material molecules are brought together. The settling of 
karmic matter in jiva is due to this contiguous coexistence. 
It cannot be said that the mind exerts an active influence. 
The commentator on Pancastikayasamayasara explains 
the relation by the analogy of the casket which becomes 
black by contact with collyrium powder. The two self- 
determining agencies somehow get harmoniously blended. 
Since direct causal relation between the two series is rejected, 
no better explanation than a mysterious harmony is possible. 

On this view knowledge becomes a mystery. It ceases 
to be the ultimate fact behind which we cannot go. We 
adopt a deliberately restricted outlook and, imagining 
an opposition between subject and object, look upon mind 
as one thing confronted by another thing called the environ- 
ment. We do not perceive things that are external, but 
have only images and pictures of them which are supposed 
to represent the external world. There cannot be any 
agreement between idea and reality unless there is a common 
factor between them. But in that case the theory of a mind

which looks out of its own chamber into an alien uni\erse 
falls to the ground. 

The soul is said to have dimensions, and be capable of 
expansion and contraction. The soul cannot be smaller 
than the physical body, for then it will not be able to feel 
the bodily affections as its own. It is of a very small size 
when it starts in the womb, but goes on gradually expanding 
with the body, till it attains to its full proportions. At 
the end of each earthly life it contracts again into the seed 
of the next birth which it has to undergo. The diffusion of 
the soul in the body is not like any other diffusion in nature, 
since the soul is simple and devoid of parts. “ Just as the 
lotus hued ruby, when placed in a cup of milk imparts its 
lustre to the milk, so the jiva residing in its own body imparts 
its lustre or intelligence to the whole body.” 1 The souls 
which are infinite in number and of medium size occupy in- 
numerable points of space in lokaka^a or the mundane world. 1 
According to 5Samkara,3 the hypothesis of the soul having the 
same size as its body is untenable, for, from its being limited 
by the body, it would follow that the soul, like the body, is 
also impermanent, and if impermanent, it would have no 
final release. Further, a soul which leaves a particular body 
will get into difficulties when, in the course of rebirth, it 
has to inhabit a larger body. We may grossly conceive 
the soul as capable of becoming bigger or smaller by addition 
or subtraction of parts. New particles will be constantly 
carried in and old particles will be getting out, so that we can 
never be sure that the same soul continues for any length 
of time. If it is said that certain essential particles remain 
unchanged, there does not seem to be any way of distinguish* 
ing between the essential and the accidental. The Jainas 
answer these objections by citing analogies. As a lamp 
whether placed in a small pot or a large room illumines the 
whole space, even so does the jiva contract and expand 
according to the dimensions of the different bodies.

in a non-qualitative manner, throughout the whole body ; moreover it is 
so present everywhere in the entirety of its essence, although it may not 
be capable of ubiquitously therein exercising all its faculties.”

Metaphysics 

In metaphysics Jainism is opposed to all theories which 
do not emphasise ethical responsibility. The ethical interest 
in human freedom is the determining consideration. The 
theories of the creation of the world by God, or its develop- 
ment out of prakrti or its unreality, are criticised on the 
ground that they cannot account for either the origin or 
the cessation of suffering. 1 To regard the intelligent subject 
as the product of the five elements is as fruitless from the 
ethical point of view as to make out that the variety of the 
world is a manifold presentation of the one intelligent prin- 
ciple. 2 3 * 5 Moral distinctions lose their value on the hypothesis 
of the passivity of the soul.3 To say that the soul is safe in 
its eternity and the events of the world are the results of 
the mechanical combination and separation of the elements 
of existence would take away the initiative from the soul 
and make moral responsibility meaningless. 4 The fatalist 
theory that all tilings are fixed by nature obviously leaves 
no room for individual effort. 5 Ethical values require that 
the individual can make or unmake himself in the world, 
and that the soul has a self-identity which it preserves 
even in the ultimate condition. 6 This metaphysical theory 
of reality may be approached by a preliminary discussion 
of the nature of substance or dravya, and mode or paryaya. 

The Jainas do not hold that being is permanent, without 
becoming, change and end. Everything is produced, con- 
tinues and is again destroyed. The definition of substance 
depends on our standpoint. It is that which always exists, as 
the universe, which has no beginning or end. It is the subject 
of qualities and modifications. Anything which has origin, 
existence and destruction is a substance. It is again that

which performs some functions. Generally, existing things 
are considered to be permanent as regards their substance 
and accidental as regards their changeable aspects. Material 
things continue to exist as matter ; as particular things 
they change. Being is not unalterable in its nature. The 
Jainas do not concern themselves about transcendental 
being, but only of being as found in experience. The 
things of the world undergo change, gaining new qualities 
and losing old ones. The possession of certain qualities in 
common makes us say that the new and the old are forms 
of one substance. Reality to them is a unity in difference 
and nothing beyond. They adopt a theory of bhedabheda 
or difference in identity. Substance is that which persists 
in and through its own qualities and modifications. Sub- 
stance and quality are inseparable. A thing is defined as 
that which has many qualities. 1 It is a dynamic reality, an 
identity which changes.* “ Substance is one, the inherent 
essence of all things, manifests itself through diverse forms, 
has the three characteristics of creation, destruction and 
staying, and may be described by opposites.” 3 

Qualities or gunas inhere in substances as materiality 
in atoms, and they cannot exist by themselves. The chief 
qualities are : (i) Existence, (2) Enjoyability, (3) Substan- 
tiveness, (4) Knowability, (5) Specific character or identity 
or essence, (6) the quality of possessing some kind of form. 
These general qualities are common to dravyas, and each of 
the latter has also its own specific features. \\ e should 
not abstract any of these qualities and exalt it to a sub- 
stantive level. Yet “ there is neither quality without 
substance nor substance without quality.” 4 The Nyaya 
theory of the absolute distinction of substance and quality 
is refuted. A thing exists in and through the qualities and 
the qualities constitute the thing. The difference is one 
of reference and not existence. “ If the substance is entirely 
separate and distinct from its qualities, then it may change 
into infinite other substances, or again, if the qualities can 
exist separate from their substance, there will be no necessity

3 “ Anantadharmatmakam vastu ’’ ; Ilaribhadra’s Saddar?anasamuc-

for a substance at all.” 1 The Nirguna Brahman theory as 
well as the Ksanikavada are implicitly refuted. 3 Substance 
and qualities may be externally related as in “ Devadatta’-s 
cow,” or internally as in the “ tall cow.” “ Just as dhana 
and jfiana (wealth and wisdom) make the owners clhani and 
jnani (rich and wise), though expressing two ways of rela- 
tionship, unity and diversity, even so the relation between 
substance and qualities implies two aspects of identity and 
difference.” 3 “ The relation between substance and quality 

is one of coeval identity, unity, inseparability and essential 
simplicity ; the unity of substance and qualities is not the 
result of union or combination. ”t 

The dravya with the qualities must exist in some form 
or state. This mode of existence is paryaya and is subject 
to change. The substance gold with its qualities of mallea- 
bility and yellowness is not subject to change. The gunas or 
qualities continue while the paryayas or forms change. There 
are two kinds of paryayas or modifications (i) Modifications 
of the essential qualities of a thing or substance. The colour 
of water may change, though colour is a constant property.5 
( 2 ) Modifications of the accidental qualities such as muddi- 
ness. Water need not always be muddy. 6 

The whole universe of being is traced to the two ever- 
lasting uncreated coexisting but independent categories of 
jiva and ajiva. The jiva is the enjoyer and the ajiva or the 
jada is the enjoyed. That which has consciousness is jiva, 
that which has not consciousness, but can be touched, 
tasted, seen and smelt, is ajiva. The latter is devoid of the 
three kinds of consciousness. It is the object.7 “ What 
knows and perceives the various objects, desires pleasure and 
dreads pain, acts beneficially or harmfully, and experiences 
the fruit thereof, that is jiva.” 8 Jiva and ajiva do not

correspond to I and not-I. It is an objective classification 
of things in the universe that underlies the distinction 
of jiva and ajlva. Animate beings are composed of soul 
and body, and their souls being distinct from matter are 
eternal. Ajlva is divided into two main classes, those without 
form (arupa), as dharma, adharma, space, time, and those 
with form (rupa), as pudgala or matter. 

The first ajiva dravya or inanimate substance is akasa 
or space. It is divided into (i) the part occupied by the 
world of things, lokakasa, and ( 2 ) the space beyond it, the 
alokakasa, which is absolutely void and empty, an abyss 
of nothing. 1 Of a point of space or pradesa, the following 
definition is given: “ Know that something to be pradesa, 
which is obstructed by one indivisible atom of pudgala, and 
w r hich can give space to all particles.” 2 In such a pradesa 
one element of dharma, one of adharma, one particle of 
kala or time, and many atoms of matter in a subtle state 
may exist. Space by itself is not a condition of motion and 
of rest. 3 Things left together hanging in space would lead 
to chaos. To produce a cosmos they must be bound by laws 
of movement and rest. Dharma is the principle of motion. 
" Dharma is devoid of qualities of taste, colour, smell, sound 
and contact. It pervades the whole world, and is continuous 
because of inseparability ; has extension because of coexten- 
siveness with space. Though in reality of ekapradesa, yet 
in vyavahara is of many pradesas.’h It is amurta or non- 
corporeal, and is continuous and non-composite. “ Because 
it has the infinite manifestations of the incorporeal nature, 
agurulaghu, and because of its dialectic nature of persist- 
ence through appearance and disappearance, it is a real 
existence. Itself being unaffected by movement, it con- 
ditions the motion of those things that can move, matter and 
life,” 5 " even as water itself, being indifferent or neutral, is 
the condition of the movement of fish.” 6 Dharma has none of 
the specific properties of matter, and yet it is a self-subsisting 
reality devoid of all sensible qualities. It is the medium of 
movement though not its cause. Adharma is the principle

of rest. It is also devoid of sense qualities, is non-corporeal 
and coextensive with lokakasa . 1 The two principles are non- 
active, non-physical, non-atomic and non-discrete in structure. 
Dharma and adharma are neutral conditions, udasinahetu, 
of movement and rest. Efficient causes are different. Other- 
wise objects would be always moving or resting. They are 
not merely the accompanying conditions of movement and 
rest, but appear to be the cosmic principles forming the 
background of all the moving and the resting things of the 
world. They are the connecting media binding together 
the chaotic crowd of isolated fragments into an ordered 
whole. It is to be carefully noted that dharma and adharma 
in Jaina philosophy do not stand for merit and demerit, 
for which it has other terms, punya and papa. They are 
the forces that cause movement and rest. Space with dharma 
and adharma forms the condition for the subsistence of all 
things, souls and matter. Space gives room to subsist, 
dharma makes it possible for things to move or be moved 
and adharma to rest. These three functions of subsistence, 
motion and rest are assigned to space in modern philosophy. 
The three are mutually interpenetrating. From the point 
of view of locality, they are of the same size and form, an 
inseparable unity. They are distinguished because of the 
difference of functions. 

Time or kala is sometimes recognised as a quasi-sub- 
stance. It is an all-pervading form of the universe on which 
are strung the successive movements of the world. It is 
not a summation of a series of discontinuous changes, but 
a process of persistence, an enduring from the past into the 
present. 

Time has astitva or existence, but no kayatva or magni- 
tude. It has no extension, being unilateral . 3 A distinction is 
made between eternal time, without form, beginning or end, 
and relative time, with beginning and end and variations 
of hour, minute, etc. The former is called kala and the

this reason, from the ordinary point of view, the omniscient call it kaya ”

latter samaya. Kala is the substantial cause of samaya. 
Vartana or continuity of changes is inferred from parinama 
or modification . 1 “ Relative time is determined by changes 
or motion in things. These changes themselves are the 
effects of absolute time .” 1 Time is called a cakra, a wheel. 
Since in course of time all things are liable to dissolution of 
form, time is also called the destroyer.3 

Matter or pudgala is the next category to be considered. 
“ Whatever is perceived by the senses, the sense organs, 
the various kinds of iariras (or bodies of jivas), the physical 
mind, the karmas, etc., are murta, or figured objects. These 
are all pudgala.” 4 “ Sound, union, fineness, grossness, 
shape, division, darkness, and image, with lustre and heat, 
are modifications of the substance known as pudgala.”5 
Matter is an eternal substance undetermined with regard 
to quantity and quality. It may increase or diminish in 
volume without any addition or loss of particles. It may 
assume any form and develop various qualities. It is the 
vehicle of energy which is essentially kinetic or of the nature 
of motion. This motion belongs to the substance pudgala, 
and is of two kinds, simple motion, or parispanda, and 
evolution, or parinama. Pudgala is the physical basis of 
the world. Matter itself is said to exist in six different 
forms of different degrees of fineness and visibility. The 
qualities of touch, taste, smell, colour and sound are 
associated with pudgala. The Jains argue that everything 
in the world except souls and space is produced from 
matter. Things which we perceive consist of gross matter. 
There is also subtile matter beyond the reach of our senses, 
and this is transformed into the different degrees of karma. 

The Jaina physics has for its chief principle the atomic 
structure of the universe. The physical objects apprehended 
by senses consist of atoms or paramanus. An absolutely 
homogeneous mass of pudgalas which by differentiation 
breaks up into several kinds of atoms qualitatively deter- 
mined is assumed. An atom (anu) has no points, beginning, 
middle or end. It is infinitesimal, eternal and ultimate.

It is neither created nor destroyed. It is amurta (formless), 
though the basis of all murta (form). Sometimes it is raid 
to have form in the sense that it can be perceived by the 
kevali or the omniscient. The atoms are said to possess 
weight. The heavier move downwards and the lighter up- 
wards. Each atom occupies one point of space or pradesa. 1 
When in the subtle state, innumerable atoms occupy the 
space of one gross atom. Each atom has a kind of taste, 
colour, smell and contact. 2 These qualities are not per- 
manent and fixed. Material things are produced by the 
combination of atoms which are subject to mutual attraction. 
Two atoms form a compound, when one is viscous and the 
other dry, or when both are of different degrees of viscousness 
and dryness. Atomic linking takes place only when the 
atoms are of unlike natures. The attraction and repulsion 
of atoms are admitted by the Jains. The movement of 
atoms is brought about by means of space, dharma and 
adharma. The compounds, or skandhas combine with others 
and so on. Pudgala therefore exists in the two forms of 
anu, or atom, and skandha, or aggregate. The skandhas 
vary from binary aggregates to infinite compounds. Every 
perceivable object is a skandha, and the physical world as a 
whole is a mahaskandha, or the great aggregate. The changes 
of the physical universe are traced to atomic disintegration 
or aggregation. 3 We have already said that the atoms are 
not constant in their nature, but are subject to change or 
development (parinama), which consists in their assuming 
new qualities. It also follows that there are not different 
kinds of atoms answering to the different elements of earth, 
water, fire and air. The atoms by developing the character- 
istic qualities of the elements become differentiated and form 
the elements. The Nyaya-Vaisesika theory holds that 
there are as many kinds of atoms as there are elements, 
while the Jainas think that the homogeneous atoms produce 
different elements by varying combinations. The qualitative 
differences of primary atoms are denied. 4 In this matter 
the Jainas agree with Leucippus and Democritus. The 
figures formed by the arrangement of the atoms into groups 
are manifold. It is said that the atom may develop a

motion of its own so swift that it traverses in one moment 
the whole universe from one end to the other. 

Karma according to the Jains is of material nature 
(paudgalika). Only thus can the Jains conceive that thoughts 
and ideas affect our character and create or modify the 
tendencies of our souls. Karma is a substantive force, matter 
in a subtle form. The kind of matter fit to manifest karma 
fills all cosmic space. It has the peculiar property of develop- 
ing the effects of merit and demerit. The soul by its commerce 
with the outer world becomes literally penetrated with the 
particles of subtle matter. These become karma and build 
up a special body called karmanasarira, which does not 
leave the soul till its final emancipation. This karmic matter 
retards the radiance of the soul. Bhavakarma is immediate 
to the jivas, while dravyakarma belongs to the body. The 
two are associated together, though they are distinct and 
separate as the conscious and the non-conscious (cetana and 
acetana). Karma works in such a way that every change 
which takes place leaves a mark which is retained and built 
into the organism to serve as the foundation for future 
action. It is there actual and acting in the nature of the 
jivas. Five classes of karmic conditions are mentioned. 
Each of these determines its corresponding bhava or mental 
state. “ On account of the rise, suppression, annihilation, 
mixed suppression or unconditioned thought, the jiva has 
five bhavas or thought conditions .” 1 The last is uncon- 
ditioned by karma, while the four others are conditioned by 
changes on the physical side. In the usual course of things 
karma takes effect and produces its proper results. The 
soul is said to be in the Audayika state. By proper effort 
karma may be prevented from taking effect for some time. 
Though it is neutralised, it is still present, like fire covered 
by ashes. The soul is then said to be in the Aupasamika 
state. When karma is not only prevented from working, 
but is annihilated altogether, then the soul is in the Ksayika 
state which leads to moksa. There is a fourth state of the 
soul, Ksayopasamika, which partakes of the nature of all the 
preceding ones. In this condition some karma is annihilated, 
some neutralised and some active. It is the state of those

whom we call good, while the Ksayika and Aupa£amika 
states belong to holy men. 1 

The ajlva thus consists of five entities, of which four 
are immaterial, amurta, viz. space, time, dharma and 
adharma, and the fifth pudgala is material, or murta, or 
figured. These five categories constitute the world or 
loka, and beyond is the immeasurable infinite called aloka. 2 

Different from matter and material things are souls, 
jivas (literally lives). In the Jaina writings the word jlva 
is variously used, and denotes life, vitality, soul and con- 
sciousness. Jiva is living experience, which is so utterly 
unlike the physical things of the outer world. The jivas 
are infinite in number and are of different kinds, (i) Nit- 
yasiddha, or the ever perfect ; (2) Mukta, or the liberated ; 
and (3) the Baddha, or the bound. The second class of jivas 
will not become embodied. They have achieved their purity 
and dwell in a state of supramundane perfection unconcerned 
with worldly affairs. The mundane jivas are a prey to 
illusion, and are condemned to submit to the yoke of matter 
through an infinite succession of lives. The freed souls are 
absolutely pure and free from any taint of matter. In 
them the partnership between soul and matter is dissolved. 

■ When karma penetrates the soul it is transformed into eight kinds of 
prakrti which make up the karniana sarira. These eight kinds of karma 
include the Jnanavaraniya, or that which obscures the inborn knowledge 
of the soul, producing different degrees of knowledge or ignorance, and 
Darsanavaraniya, or that which obscures right intuitions ; Vedanlya, or that 
which obscures the blissful nature of the soul and produces pleasure, pain, 
and Mohaniya or that which disturbs the right attitude of the soul with 
regard to faith, conduct, passions and emotions, and produces doubt, error 
and other mental disturbances. The other four deal -with the status of 
an individual being : Ayuska. or that which determines the length of life 
in one birth ; Kama or that which produces the various circumstances or 
elements which collectively make up an individual existence, the body with 
its general and specific qualities ; Gotra, or that which determines the 
nationality, caste, family and social standing of an individual ; and Antarava, 
or that which obstructs the inborn energy of the soul and prevents the doing 
of good even when there is a desire for it. 

Connected with the karma theory is the doctrine of lesyas, of which there 
are six. The totality of karmas taken up by a soul induce in it a trans- 
cendental colour or complexion which cannot be perceived by the naked 
eye. These have a moral bearing. The state of a soul is produced by its 
inborn nature and the karma with which it is associated. Each kind of 
karma has its predestined limits within which it must be purged off.

They are the nirupadhi jivas, which lead a life of pure exist- 
ence and infinite consciousness, and possess infinite know- 
ledge (anantaj nana), infinite perception (anantadarsana), 
infinite power (anantavirya) and infinite bliss (ananta- 
sukha). The sopadhi jivas, which are wandering in the 
circle of existence, are pursued by the cruel parasite matter. 
Through ignorance the jiva identifies itself with matter. 
It is clear that jiva in the sense of the freed indicates the 
pure subject, which is simple and incorruptible. It answers 
to the Upanisad Atman, the logical, self-existing, unchange- 
able subject precedent to all cognition, feeling and will. 
As applied to the impure samsarin, jiva is an empirical 
category determined by life. This ambiguous usage is 
responsible for a good deal of confusion in the Jaina meta- 
physics. Except in final release the soul is always in connec- 
tion with matter, the link between the two being karma. 
The soul persists throughout all changes and is not a product 
of the body. The Jains admit that there is no creation 
of a new substance or destruction of the old. It is only 
a fusion of elements in a new form. The jivas are many, 
but are alike eternal. Their characteristic essence is con- 
sciousness or cetana, which is never destroyed, however 
much it is obscured by external causes. They are regarded 
as possessing size which is varying in different cases. They 
contract and expand according to the dimensions of the 
body with which they are incorporated for the time being. 
The question of the different kinds of jivas is important 
for the Jainas, in view of their insistence on ahimsa, or the 
inviolability of life. Jivas are divided according to the 
number of sense organs they possess. The highest are those 
which have five senses : touch, taste, smell, sight and 
hearing (pancendriya). The lowest have one sense, touch 
(ekendriya). Between the two come those with two, three 
and four senses. The higher animals, men and gods, possess 
a sixth internal organ (manas), and are said to be rational . 1 
The senses and bodies do not constitute the essence of the 
soul, which lies in the consciousness underlying them all . 2 
The soul is not distinct from its attribute of jnana or know- 
ledge, and since the ways of knowledge are diverse, the

world of reality is also said to be multiverse by the wise.* 
Self and its knowledge are inseparable. In unredeemed 
souls knowledge and joy are contracted. Everything from 
the solar system to the dewdrop has a soul, and not merely 
men and animals. There are elemental souls, e.g. earth souls, 
fire souls, which live and die and are born again in the same 
or other elemental bodies. These are either gross or subtle. 
In the latter case they are invisible. Plants are the jivas 
of one sense. Each plant may be the body of one soul, or 
may possess a multitude of embodied souls. Though some 
other Indian philosophers also admit that plants possess 
souls, the Jaina thinkers have developed this theory in 
a remarkable way. Plants in which only one soul is embodied 
are always gross, and exist in the habitable part of the world 
only. But those plants of which each is a colony of plant 
lives may be subtle, and therefore invisible, and be distri- 
buted all over the world. These subtle plants are called 
nigoda. They are composed of an infinite number of souls, 
forming a very small cluster, with respiration and nutrition 
in common. Innumerable nigodas form a globule, and the 
world is packed with them. These nigodas supply souls 
in the vacancies caused by those who have attained nirvana. 
It is said that an infinitesimally small fraction of one single 
nigoda has furnished souls in place of those liberated from 
the beginninglcss past down to the present. We cannot 
therefore hope that the world will at any time be empty of 
living beings . 2 A peculiar feature of the Jaina theory is 
its doctrine that there are souls even in inorganic objects, 
like metals and stones. 

The condition of a soul depends on the condition of its 
body. In an inorganic body the soul’s consciousness is 
dormant, while it just stirs in the organic body. Conscious- 
ness is active in human beings. Compare the saying : “ All 
flesh is not the same flesh : but there is one kind of flesh 
of men, another flesh of beasts, another of fishes, and another 
of birds.” 

The jiva is characterised by knowledge, and though it 
has no form, is yet an agent enjoying the fruits of karma

and possessing the same extent as the body. 1 It undergoes 
real changes, otherwise it cannot be a causal agent. 3 It 
is the upadanakartr or the material cause of bhavas, or 
thoughts, while karmic matter is the nimitta, or the deter- 
mining caused The potter has the idea (bhava), and the pot 
exists in his consciousness, and there arises the actual pot 
with the material clay. Yet throughout its infinite forms 
the soul maintains its nature or identity. Birth and death 
are only paryayas, or modifications of the soul. The freed 
soul is one with the soul in sarhsarad It is not necessary 
for the soul to be always entangled in the meshes of the 
dialectic process of evolution. In other words, it can main- 
tain its existence independent of the body. Consciousness 
is a reality independent of matter and in no sense its product. 
It is eternal, with neither beginning nor end. Only com- 
pounds break up and are annihilated. 

We have now described briefly the five ajlva dravyas 
and the sixth jiva. Of these six all else, excepting time, are 
astikayas,5 or spatial existences, and have the possibility 
of spatial relations. Time is real, but is non-spatial. It is 
therefore a dravya, or substance possessing independent 
existence, but not an astikaya, or an extensive magnitude. 
The several dravyas can move in the same place and inter- 
penetrate without losing their essential nature. The six 
dravyas of the Jainas are different from the nine elements 
of the Vaisesika theory : earth, air, light, water, akasa or 
ether, kala or time, dik or direction, manas and souls. The 
first four are brought under matter by the Jainas. They are 
the common properties of matter corresponding to the different 
senses. On account of the transmutability and the liability 
of different particles to fuse, matter is considered a unit. 
The Vaisesikas look upon akasa as the source of sound, 
while the Jainas consider sound to be produced by the vibra- 
tions of material particles. 6 

The two jiva and ajiva are exhaustive categories of the 
universe. Of the six dravyas, jiva and pudgala form 
the chief. The others are the principle of their action or 
the results of their interaction. Sarhsara is nothing but the

entanglement of jiva in matter. Jiva and pudgala are 
the sakriya dravyas, or efficient causes, which move from 
place to place. Dharma and adharma condition movements, 
but are neither direct causes nor indirect conditions of change, 
and are therefore called sakriyaniskriya dravyas. The 
link of union between jiva and ajiva is karma. The pro- 
duction, fruition and destruction of karma, together with 
jiva and ajiva, are the principles or tattvas of Jainism. 1 * 
Jiva and ajiva are the main principles, which are generally 
united. The absolute liberation of jiva from ajiva is moksa. 
It is the goal of all endeavour. This ideal can be realised 
only by the stoppage and shedding of karma. Samvara is 
that which stops. By it we block the channels through 
which karma finds entrance into the soul. Nirjara is that 
which utterly and entirely wears away all sins previously 
committed. The need for these two arises on account of asrava, 
or inflow, and bandha, or bondage. Asrava is the influx 
of alien matter into the soul. Bandha is what binds the 
soul to the body. It is caused by wrong belief (mithyadar- 
sana), non-renunciation (avirati), carelessness (pramada), 
passions (kasaya), and vibrations set up in the soul through 
mind, body and speech (yoga). 3 4 Mithyatva is simply taking 
a thing for what it is not. 3 While inflow and bondage 
are the results of wrong karma, stoppage and shedding 
result from right conduct. Throughout we have the distinc- 
tion of bhava (mental) and dravya (physical) changes. 
The thoughts determine karma. 4 

The cause of the soul’s embodiment is the presence in 
it of karmic matter. It is this that spoils the natural qualities 
of the soul, knowledge and intuition. The soul is never 
completely separated from matter until its final release. 
The defilement of the soul happens thus. Subtle matter 
ready to be transformed into karma pours into the soul. 
As each particular karma is caused by some act, good, bad

or indifferent, so it in its turn produces certain painful or 
pleasant consequences. When a particular karma produces 
its effect it is purged from the soul, and if this process of 
discharge should take place uninterruptedly, all taint of 
matter will be abolished. But, unfortunately, purging and 
binding go on together, and the soul continues to move in 
the circle of samsara. At death the soul, with its karmana- 
Sarira, goes in a few moments to the place of its new birth, 
and there assumes a fresh body, expanding or contracting 
according to the dimensions of the latter. The mundane 
souls are divided into four classes according to the place of 
their birth : (i) those born in hell, (2) those in the animal 
world, (3) those in human society, and (4) those in the divine 
kingdom. 1

Ethics 

If deliverance is to be achieved, the lower matter is to 
be subdued by the higher spirit. When the soul is free from 
the weight which keeps it down, it rises up to the top of the 
universe where the liberated dwell. The radical conversion 
of the inner man is the way to freedom. The apparatus of 
morality is necessary to bring about the reformation of 
man’s nature and prevent the formation of new karma. 
The way to nirvana lies through the three jewels (triratna) 
of faith in Jina, knowledge of his doctrine and perfect conduct. 
“ Belief in real existence or tattvas is right faith ; knowledge 
of real nature without doubt or error is right knowledge. 
An attitude of neutrality without desire or aversion towards 
the objects of the external world is right conduct.” z The 
three together form one path, and are to be simultaneously 
pursued. Virtue consists in the fivefold conduct of one 
who has knowledge and faith. (1) Innocence, or ahimsa, 
which is not mere negative abstention, but positive kindness 
to all creation ; (2) charity and truth speaking; (3) honourable 
conduct such as not stealing ; (4) chastity in word, thought 
and deed ; and (5) renunciation of all worldly interests mark

the good man. The last rule is sometimes interpreted in 
an extreme way that good men should go naked. It only 
signifies that so long as we are conscious of distinctions and 
open to a sense of shame, salvation is distant from us. The 
Jaina ethics lay stress on both faith and works. A distinc- 
tion is drawn between the code for laymen and that for 
ascetics. 1 All those actions which lead to peace of mind are 
punya. There are nine ways of obtaining punya or merit 
such as giving food to the deserving, water to the thirsty, 
clothes to the poor, shelter to monks, etc. Hirhsa, or 
infliction of suffering, is the great sin or papa. Other sins 
are untruthfulness, dishonesty, unchastity, covetousness. 
Anger, conceit, deceit, avarice tie us down to the world, and 
their opposites of patience, humility, simplicity and content- 
ment further the growth of the spiritual instincts. Other 
sins, such as hatred, quarrelsomeness, slander, defamation, 
abuse of others, lack of self-control, hypocrisy and false 
faith are also mentioned. Sin is no offence against God, 
but only against man. 

He prayeth well, who loveth well 
Both man and bird and beast. 

He prayeth best who loveth best 
All things both great and small. 

Coleridge. 

The ethical system of the Jainas is more rigorous than 
that of the Buddhists. It looks upon patience as the highest 
good and pleasure as a source of sin. 2 Man should attempt 
to be indifferent to pleasure and pain. True freedom consists 
in an independence of all outer things. “ That jiva, which 
through desire for outer things experiences pleasurable or 
painful states, loses his hold on self and gets bewildered, 
and led by outer things. He becomes determined by the 
other.” 3 ‘ That jiva, which being free from relations to 

others and from alien thoughts through its own intrinsic 
nature of perception and understanding perceives and knows 
its own eternal nature to be such, is said to have conduct

that is absolutely self-determined.” 1 “ Man ! Thou art 

thine own friend ; why wishest thou for a friend beyond 
thyself ? ” 1 We do not have absolute fatalism, for though 
karma decides all, our present life, which is in our power, 
can modify the effects of the past. It is possible for us to 
evade the effects of karma by extraordinary exertions. 
Nor is there any interference by God. The austere heroes 
are blessed not because of the uncertain whims of a capricious 
God, but by the order of the universe of which they themselves 
are a part. Meditation is enjoined, since it enables us to 
acquire strength for fulfilling the vows.3 The rigorous 
character of the discipline may be inferred from the eleven 
stages of a householder’s life and the fourteen stages of 
the evolution of the soul. This grim ideal of asceticism 
has been practised in India by many great devotees who 
did themselves to death. 

The chief feature of Jainism is ahimsa, or respect for and 
abstinence from everything that has life. The scrupulous 
enforcement of this rule has led to many practices which 
come in for cheap sneering at the hands of unsympathetic 
students. Lest any life be destroyed, some Jains sweep 
the ground as they go, walk veiled for fear of inhaling a 
living organism, strain water and reject even honey. It 
is true that ahirhsa in the strict sense cannot be practised. 
The Mahabharata says : “ The world is filled with creatures 
which cannot be seen by the eye, though inferred by logic. 
When we move our eyelids, their limbs break and fall.” 4 
The Bhagavatapurana declares that “life is the life of life.” 5 
When these simple truths are forgotten, life becomes well- 
nigh impossible. A morbid fear of injuring perchance any 
life anywhere governs the conduct of the orthodox Jains. 

While Buddhism repudiates suicide. Jainism holds that 
it “ increaseth life.” If asceticism is hard to practise, if 
we cannot resist our passions and endure austerities, suicide 
is permitted. It is sometimes axgued that after twelve years 
of ascetic preparation one can kill himself, since nirvana is 
assured. As usual with the systems of the time, women

are looked upon as objects of temptation. 1 In common 
with other systems of Indian thought and belief, Jainism 
believes in the possibility of non-Jainas reaching the goal if 
only they follow the ethical rules laid down. Ratnasekhara 
in the opening lines of his Sambodhasattari says : “ No matter 
whether he is a Svetambara or a Digambara, a Buddhist or 
a follower of any other creed, one who has realised the self- 
sameness of the soul, i.e. looks on all creatures as his own 
self, attains salvation.” 

The Jainas are not opposed to the caste system, which 
they try to relate to character. “ By one’s actions one 
b?comes a Brahmin, or a Ksatriya, or a Vaisya, or a 
£udra. . . . Him who is exempt from all karmas we call 
a Brahmin.” 1 " The Jains and the Buddhists use the word 

Brahmin as an honorific title, applying it even to persons 
who did not belong to the caste of Brahmins.” 3 The ex- 
clusiveness and pride born of caste are condemned by the 
Jainas. The Sutrakrtanga denounces the pride of birth 
as one of the eight kinds of pride by which man commits 
sin. 4 

The Jain sarigha, or community, is fourfold, containing 
monks and nuns, lay-brothers and lay-sisters. With the 
Buddhists the lay-members were not organically connected 
with the clergy. With a smaller constituency than that of 
Buddhism, with no missionary zeal, Jainism has survived 
in India, while Buddhism has passed away. Mrs. Stevenson 
offers an explanation for this fact. " The character of 
Jainism was such as to enable it to throw out tentacles 
to help it in its hour of need. It had never, like Buddhism, 
cut itself off from the faith that surrounded it, for it had 
always employed Brahmins as its domestic chaplains, who 
presided at its birth rites, and often acted as officiants at 
its death and marriage ceremonies and temple worship 
Then, too, amongst its chief heroes it had found niches for 
some of the favourites of the Hindu pantheon, Rama, Krsna 
and the like. Mahavlra’s genius for organisation also stood

« Yet the Jains recruit their clergy from certain families in preference 
to others. They observe caste within the community.

Jainism in good stead now, for he had made the laity an 
integral part of the community, whereas in Buddhism they 
had no part nor lot in the order. So, when storms of perse- 
cution swept over the land. Jainism simply took refuge in 
Hinduism, which opened its capacious bosom to receive it ; 
and to the conquerors it seemed an indistinguishable part 
of that great system.” 1 

The materialistic view of karma leads the Jains to attribute 
more importance than the Buddhists, to the outer act in 
contrast to the inner motive. Both Buddhism and Jainism 
admit the ideal of negation of life and personality. To both 
life is a calamity to be avoided at all costs. They require 
us to free ourselves from all the ties that bind us to nature 
and bring us sorrow. They glorify poverty and purity, 
peace and patient suffering. Hopkins caricatures the 
Jaina system when he calls it, “ a religion in which the 
chief points insisted upon are that one should deny God, 
worship man and nourish vermin.” * The remarkable 
resemblance between Jainism and Buddhism, in their ethical 
aspects, is due to the fact that they both borrow from the 
same Brahmanical sources. “ The Brahmin ascetic was the 
model from which they borrowed many important practices 
and institutions of ascetic life.” 3 ^

Attitude to Theism 

The development of the world is rendered possible by 
the doctrine of the indefiniteness of being and interaction 
of substances. There is no god necessary for creation or 
destruction. “ There can be no destruction of things that 
do exist, nor can there be creation of things out of nothing. 
Coming into existence and ceasing to exist, things have, 
because of their attributes and modes.” 4 The substances 
by their interaction produce new sets of qualities. 1 he 
Jains repudiate the theory of the creation of the world out

of nothing or a series of accidents. The systematic working 
of the laws of nature cannot be a product of luck or accident. 
There is no need to assume with the theologian any first 
cause of the universe. We cannot conceive how a non- 
creative God suddenly becomes creative. On such a hypo- 
thesis the question of the material out of which the world 
is created is difficult to answer. Did it or did it not exist 
in some form prior to the making of the world ? If it is 
said that it all depends on the inscrutable will of God, we 
should put an end to all science and philosophy. If things 
can function only in obedience to the will of God, there is 
no reason why they should be endowed with distinct attri- 
butes. Different substances need not have specific functions 
which cannot be exchanged. Water can burn and fire cool 
if that be the will of God. As a matter of fact, however, 
we find that different substances have their own specific 
functions belonging to their own nature, and the substances 
themselves would be destroyed if their functions were 
annihilated. If it is argued that everything that exists must 
have a maker, then that maker himself would stand in need 
of another maker, and we should be landed in an infinite 
regress. The way of escape from this circle is to assume the 
reality of a self-subsisting maker, who is the author of every- 
thing else. The Jaina thinker asks, If it be possible for 
one being to be self-subsistent and eternal, is it not possible 
for more things and beings to be uncreated and substantive ? 
He puts forth the hypothesis of a number of substances, and 
the world is explained on the theory of the necessity of the 
substances to manifest themselves. The whole universe of 
being consisting of mental and material factors has existed 
from all eternity, undergoing an infinite number of revolu- 
tions produced by the powers of nature without the inter- 
vention of any eternal deity. The diversities of the world 
are traced to the five co-operating conditions of time (kala), 
nature (svabhava), necessity (niyati), activity (karma), and 
desire to be and act (udyama). The seed may be instinct 
with powers, but before it grows into a tree it must have 
the help of the time or season, natural environment and the 
act of its being placed in the soil. Its own nature determines 
the kind of tree into which it grows. 



PLURALISTIC REALISM OF THE JAINAS 331 

Though there is no such being distinct from the world 
called God, yet certain of the elements of the world when 
properly developed obtain deification. These are the arhats, 
the supreme lords, the omniscient souls who have overcome 
all faults. Though there is no divine creative spirit, still 
every soul when it reaches its highest perfection becomes 
a Paramatman or supreme soul . 1 God is only the highest, 
noblest and fullest manifestation of the powers which lie 
latent in the soul of man. All perfect men are divine, and 
there is no rank among them, since all are equal. 

Strictly speaking, there is no room for devotion or bhakti 
in the Jaina system. All attachment according to it should 
cease. Personal love is to be burnt up in the glow of asceticism. 
But weak man is obliged to develop a sort of devotion towards 
the great tirthankaras, however much strict logic may 
prohibit it. The lay members demanded a creed and a cult 
suited to their moral and religious condition. When Jainism 
began to spread beyond the place of its origin, the necessity 
to satisfy the religious aspirations of the normal man became 
urgent. Otherwise, worshippers of other gods could not be 
converted into Jainism. When followers of the Krsna cult 
came into the fold of Jainism, a relationship was established 
between the 22nd Tirthaiikara (Aristanemi) and Krsna. 
Many Hindu gods crept in, so that to-day we find divisions 
of Jainas into the Vaisnavas and the non-Vaisnavas. 

The life of a god in heaven is one of the forms that a 
soul might assume by the acumulation of merit. When the 
merit is exhausted, that life passes away. Gods are only 
embodied souls like men and animals, different from them 
in degree, but not in kind. The greater power and perfec- 
tion belonging to the divine body and organism are the 
rewards of the good deeds of a former life. The liberated 
souls are above the gods. They are never born again. They 
have no longer any connexion with the world and exert 
no influence on it. They do not look to the steep ascent 
leading to the goal or offer a helping hand to those struggling 
on the upward path. When prayers are addressed to the 
famous Jinas who have reached perfection and passed out

of the world of change and woe, they cannot and do not 
return answers to the prayers, since they are utterly in- 
different to all that happens in the world and are entirely 
free from all emotion. But there are the gods who watch and 
control true discipline. 1 They hear the prayers and bestow 
favours. So far as the Jinas are concerned, the best mode 
of worshipping them is to adopt their advice. Realisation 
of one’s true self and not devotion to Tlrthaiikaras is the 
way to freedom. 3 Meditation or adoration of the Jina 
sanctifies the soul. Since the severely simple religion of 
the Jainas did not admit grace or forgiveness, it could not 
appeal to the masses, and so halting compromises were made.

Nirvana 

Nirvana or deliverance is not annihilation of the soul, 
but its entry into a blessedness that has no end. It is an 
escape from the body, though not from existence. We 
have already said that the liberated being by avoiding all 
emotions becomes characterless, with no interest in the lives 
of its fellows or inclination to help them. “ The liberated 
is not long nor small . . . nor black, nor blue, nor bitter, 
nor pungent : neither cold nor hot. . . . Without body, without 
rebirth ... he perceives, he knows, but there is no analogy, 
(whereby we can know the nature of the liberated soul) ; 
its essence is without form ; there is no condition of the 
unconditioned.” 3 The siddha state is not the cause or the 
effect of the samsara series. It is absolutely unconditioned. 4 
Causality has no hold on the redeemed soul. “ Know that 
from the ordinary point of view, perfect faith, knowledge and 
conduct are the causes of liberation, while in reality one’s 
own soul consisting of these three (is the cause of liberation). ”5 
We cannot say anything positive about the freed soul, nor 
can we strictly speaking know that there is a plurality of 
liberated souls. The state of perfection is passively described

as freedom from action and desire, a state of utter and abso- 
lute quiescence, a rest that knows no change or ending, a 
passionless and ineffable peace. The energy of past karma 
is extinguished, and the spirit, though still existent, has no 
chance of re-embodiment. Though not quite consistently, 
positive descriptions are given of the freed soul as that it 
has infinite consciousness, pure understanding, absolute 
freedom and eternal bliss. 1 It can perceive and know, since 
perception and knowledge are functions of the soul and not 
of the sense organs. The freed soul has a beginning but no 
end, while a bound soul has no beginning but has an end. 
These freed souls enjoy a kind of interpenetrating existence 
on account of their oneness of status. Their soul substance 
has a special power by which an infinity of souls could 
exist without mutual exclusion. The identity of the 
saved is determined by the living rhythm retaining the 
form of the last physical life and by the knowledge of 
the past. This ideal of freedom is manifested in the 
most perfect degree in the lives of the twenty-four Jain 
tirthaiikaras. 

The loka, or the universe, is held in the middle of the 
aloka, in the form of the trunk of the man, with siddha£ila 
at the top, the place where the head should be. This 
siddhasila is the abode of the omniscient souls, and may be 
called the spiritual eye of the universe. So moksa is said 
to be eternal upward movement. 2 * On liberation the soul 
goes upward, because of the momentum due to its previous 
activity, 3 the non-existence of the relation to the elements 
which kept it down, 4 breaking of the bondage, 5 and its 
natural tendency to go upwards. 6

Conclusion 

Jainism offers us an empirical classification of things 
in the universe, and so argues for a plurality of spirits. In 
logic, as we have seen, it takes its stand on the relativity of 
knowledge, the obvious fact that the relations of objects 
within the world are not fixed or independent, but are the 
results of interpretation. Moreover, the theory that reality 
and meaning are inseparable makes for monism in meta- 
physics and not pluralism. As a matter of fact, the plural- 
istic universe in Jainism is only a relative point of view, and 
not an ultimate truth. 

Jainism looks upon the universe as filled with jlvas, 
even as Leibniz thought that the world was filled with 
monads. “ In the smallest particle of matter there is a 
world of living creatures, entelechies or souls. Each portion 
of matter may be conceived as like a garden full of plants, 
or like a pond full of fishes. But each branch of every plant, 
each member of any animal, each drop of its liquid parts, 
is also some such garden or pond. And though the earth 
and the air which are between the plants of the garden, or 
the water which is between the fish of the pond, be neither 
plant nor fish, yet they also contain plants and fishes, but 
mostly so minute as to be imperceptible to us. Thus there 
is nothing fallow, nothing sterile, nothing dead in the universe, 
no chaos, no confusion save in appearance, somewhat as it 
might appear to be in a pond at a distance, in which one 
would see a confused movement and, as it were, a swarming 
of fish in the pond without separately distinguishing the 
fish themselves.” We shall see that the metaphysical 
scheme of the Jainas has affinities with Leibniz’s monadism 
and Bergson’s creative evolutionism . 1 

A jiva is whatever is living, whatever is not mechanical. 
It answers to the life element of Bergson. It is also a subject 
of experience, and corresponds to the monad of Leibniz. 

1 Though in its origin the Jaina view might have been a rather crude 
form oi physical science, later Jama thinkers developed definite philosophical 
grounds capable of being clearly stated and defended. 



PLURALISTIC REALISM OF THE JAINAS 335 


It is anything for which the mechanical explanation is 
inadequate. Since Jainism is the product of an age of 
immature philosophising, we find that it is not clearly aware 
of the exact distinctions between jiva and Atman, ajlva 
and matter. A jiva is a particular kind of existent thing. 
The liberated jiva freed from matter is called the Atman. 
The Atman is pure consciousness untainted by matter. It 
excludes all space and externality. It is the jiva purified 
and raised to its highest spiritual status, which is mere 
formless consciousness. Pudgala is not pure matter untouched 
by consciousness. It already bears the impress of spirit. 
Atman is spirit or being, and matter is the negative principle 
of non-being. The latter corresponds to the space of Bergson 
or the materia prima of Leibniz. The bare materiality of 
pudgala is the direct opposite of spirit. It is mere difference, 
and therefore according to Jaina logic unreal. A jiva is 
a combination of the two. It is material — spiritual . 1 It 
is the soul loaded with matter, involved in bondage. All 
jlvas in samsara are associated with this negative material 
element. Jainism believes that these three, Atman or the 
pure spirit, pure matter, and jiva, which is a combination of 
the two, are existent, though the first two are imperceptible 
to us. The pudgala skandha, which we see, has also an 
element of consciousness, and is as much a jiva as anything 
else so far as its essence is concerned. The jiva and the 
ajiva of the Jainas are not the empirical abstractions of 
Atman or consciousness and matter or non-consciousness, but 
the products of an interaction between the two. The pudgala 
bears on it the impress of self, and the jiva is already pene- 
trated by matter. It is an inaccurate usage that makes us 
confuse ]iva and ajiva with being and non-being. Strictly 
speaking, Atman and non-Atman are the primary elements, 
the two irreconcilable and antagonistic principles. Jiva 
possesses more of self, ajiva more of not-self. They repre- 
sent two orders of arrangement in the whole. 

To the empirical vision the jivas constitute the universe, 
and every jiva is a concrete unity, a compound substance. 
It is a one in many, or a many in one. The relation between 
the two is beginningless In the world of samsara the two

336 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

are never separated. The goal of all jlvas towards which 
they ought to strive is the shedding off of all matter. All 
centres of living activity are jlvas. 

In the universe, we are told, the two Atman and matter, 
subject and object, are always found together. Throughout 
experience we have the strife between the two, where the 
one tries to dominate the other. It is interesting to know 
that the spiritual element of the jiva is said to possess an 
upward tendency, while the material element has a downward 
tendency. A jiva inhabiting the body of a human being 
may become so weighted with matter that it passes into 
an earthly life. 

We have gradations of jivas according as they exhibit 
more or less of the dominance of self over not-self. In 
the highest stages of divine existence, the level of gods to 
be distinguished from that of pure souls or siddhatmans, 
who have no taint of matter, we have the largest amount of 
the domination of self and the not-self is at its lowest 
conceivable point. In the lowest stages we have the pure 
externality of things to things where the not-self is at its 
highest. As we rise to plants and animals, we have more 
of self and less of not-self. They have a unity and a sim- 
plicity which constitute their individuality. They carry their 
past in their present activity. When we attain to the 
status of gods, the not-self is at its lowest point. The joy 
of life rises to the god-rhythm of the universe. In things 
between the metals and the gods, self and not-self are at 
strife. In pure soul and in bare matter we have exclusively 
the spiritual and the non-spiritual ; only they are not the 
reals of experience. 

Can we say that the plurality of jivas on this hypothesis 
is the ultimate truth of metaphysics ? We are told that 
in jivas thcis are two separate tendencies at work. The 
world open to us has this duality of self and not-self, sat 
and asat. The sat is real, the soul with its omniscience ; 
the asat is the element which obscures this fact of omniscience 
and makes the jiva a limited one In its innate nature, in 
its omniscient overflow, the soul is said to fill the whole 
universe, but the jiva becomes reduced to a single point 
in which the universe is reflected as into a centre. It is 



PLURALISTIC REALISM OF THE JAINAS 337 


asat that is the basis of individuality. It is the negative 
principle that makes the jiva a separate centre of interests, 
a limited expression of the omniscient soul, an existence 
in the psychological order. The bodj constitutes the 
degree of imperfection and gives a standpoint to the soul. 
The different kinds of jivas, metals, plants, animals, men 
and gods, are distinct, because their bodies are distinct. 
It follows that, though the soul which dwells in them all 
is the same, the negative principle of matter creates the 
empirical distinctness of individuals. “ The separateness 
and individuality of a jiva is only from the point of view of 
vyavahara, or experience. Truly speaking, the essence of 
all jivas is consciousness-*” 1 Plurality of souls is a relative 
conception which reality presents when we lay stress on 
sensation, feeling and bondage, as if they were the only true 
moments of the real. We were obliged to transcend the 
conception of an empirical centre and rise to a logical subject 
in the Jaina theory of knowledge. The subject is such a 
persistent fact that the whole world is only for it . 3 When 
reflection by imperfect abstraction reduces the subject to 
a finite mind conditioned by an organism, with a particular 
location in space and time, we get the idea of the independence 
of the jivas. In other words, to use Sarhkara’s famous 
expressions, we have the doctrine of the plurality of jivas 
only so long as we treat the subject as an object which can 
be scrutinised. If we follow the implications of thought 
and disentangle the subject from embodiment in sensation 
and feeling, free it from all contact with the object, we shall 
see that there is only one subject in reality. Jainism did 
not choose to realise this height or look towards this ideal, 
and it is true that this exercise of thought is difficult at 
our level. For human thought a barrier is fixed between 
the ideal and the actual. We are compelled by our finite- 
ness to start with particulars from which we cannot shake 
ourselves free.

1 Compare Bosanquet : “ It is freely admitted that in cognition the 
self is universal. It goes out into a world which is beyond its ora given 
being, and what it meets there it holds in common with other selves, and 
in holding it ceases to be a self-contained and repellent unit.” ( Gifjord 
Lectures, Second Series, chap, ii.) 



338 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

Jainism even considers the theory of the oneness of the 
absolute and argues against it. “ If there were but one 
soul common to all beings, they could not be known from 
one another nor could they experience different lots ; there 
would not be Brahmins, Ksatriyas, Vaisyas and Sud as, 
insects, birds and snakes ; all would b men and gods. 
We make equal both those who lead a blameable life and 
those who in this world practise right conduct.” 1 There 
is no need to deny the plurality at the psychological or the 
empirical level, where only the question of the enjoyment 
of the fruits of karma arises. Where the mind is bound by 
organic conditions the doctrine of plurality has meaning, but 
our question is, can we consider this limited jiva to be the 
ultimate truth ? If this limitation be an essential condition 
of the soul which it can never shake off, then the plurality 
of jivas is real, but the Jainas believe that the limitations 
are accidental in the sense that they do not pertain to the 
essence of the soul, and in the state of freedom the soul is 
utterly freed from them. In that case we shall be illogical 
if we consider the accidental plurality of souls to be the final 
expression of truth. It is an accepted canon of metaphysical 
criticism that what is not at he beginning or end cannot be 
said to be really in its present process . 2 Plurality may be 
actual or existent, but it is not real. 

It is not possible for us to support the doctrine of the 
plurality of souls when we have no means of finding out 
whether in the ultimate condition there is any basis of dis- 
tincti< n. Salvation is inconsistent with a separate person- 
ality that is throughout hampered by what is external and 
contingent and is bound up with the bodily organism and 
nature itself. The particularity of self opens the way to error 
and sin, and salvation means the abolition of this particularity. 

Metaphysically, the question of monism or dualism 
is determined by the relation of the two tendencies at 
work in the world. The Jainas do not take up the question 
of origins. We have no attempt at deducing the categories 
or supplying a rigid proof of their ultimateness. They 
repudiate the theory of an extra-cosmic deity conceived

PLURALISTIC REALISM OF THE JAINAS 339 


of as a whimsical despot. We do not misrepresent 
the Jaina theory if we say that it looks upon God, nature 
and soul as aspects of the same. There is no God except 
the soul in its ideal integrity. To conceive of God in 
any other way is to make him finite. The mind of man 
excludes itself from others and is of a limited nature, but 
if we get a mind which is not restricted by limitations, 
but can present itself to itself in its completeness, then the 
limitations that characterise human experience pass away. 
The eternal consciousness is within the human experience. 
It is the power that directs us to get beyond all finite forms. 
In knowledge with the unity of content it establishes for all 
minds, we are lifted above the psychological self, which is 
exclusive of others. From the mind conditioned by space 
and time we reach a mind through which alone space and 
time relations arise. The infinite is inherent in the finite. 
That is why the finite is ever struggling to break down its 
finiteness and reach out to the fullest freedom, and when 
the freedom of spirit is reached all is overcome. There 
cannot be any system of jivas apart from such a spirit. 

What is the relation between the spiritual and the material 
tendencies which are struggling in the world of experience ? 
Are they differences within a whole ? They seem to be well 
adapted to each other and to promote the progress of the 
whole. While they are opposed to each other, they do not 
seem to be opposed to the unity which is a synthesis of 
opposites. By emphasising such facts the Jaina theory 
would be led to the hypothesis of a concrete universal, a 
reality at once divided and united. To such a view there 
would be nothing purely spiritual or purely material. Both 
these are abstractions of logic. The real is a concrete whole 
of which pure being and pure matter are abstractions. They 
are moments of the one universal, antagonistic, but insepar- 
able elements of one whole. The universal is manifesting 
itself in the life of the world. The struggle of opposites is 
present in all degrees of reality, though their opposition is 
overcome in the harmony of the absolute. If Jaina logic 
looks upon thought as the ultimate category and regards 
the central nature of reality as what is revealed by thought, 
then a concrete monism will be the result A pure spirit, 



340 INDIAN PHILOSOPHY 

an abstract absolute, with nothing to struggle against, 
an actionlcss spiritual energy, a motionless being is mere 
nothing. Yet inconsistently Jainism asserts a condition of 
soul completely severed from matter, an upward movement 
without the potentiality of the downward in it. Kumarila 
urges that the reality of siddhatmans cannot be estab- 
lished by logical proof. “ No omniscient being is perceived 
by us here. Nor can his reality be established by inference .” 1 
The Jainas take their stand on the innate nature of the 
soul, which can be manifested when the hindrances are 
removed. Even Kumarila agrees that the soul has a natural 
capacity for grasping all things, and there are w’ays and 
means by which we can develop this capacity. If we em- 
phasise this aspect of Jaina philosophy and remember that 
there is intuitional knowledge of the kevalin, which is higher 
than thought, we are led to a monism absolute and unlimited, 
which would require us to look upon the striving world, where 
all things roam about midway between reality and nothing- 
ness, as unreal. We can look upon the world as real only 
when we shut out of view the highest aspect of pure spirit. 
If we recognise it, then the not-self is merely the other of 
self, some reflection thereof not quite as real as the self, 
something which is ultimately to be sublated. The world 
becomes then an appearance created by the force of the 
not-self. In this way we are led to a severe monism of 
the type advanced by £amkara. One thing, however, is 
clear, that it is only by stopping short at a half-way house 
that Jainism is able to set forth a pluralistic realism.
